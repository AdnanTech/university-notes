# Week eleven

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **bitwise operators.** I found the Bitwise operators lectures themselves pretty interesting, although they are completely unrelated to any assignments as of the first term.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week our lectures were based around the concept of **revision** and **revision techniques**. To be brutally honest, and this will be a personal take for the most part, but I found the lecture content to be completely redundant. This is due to the fact I am already well versed in metacognitive skills, and manage my time in an organised fashion.

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The agenda this week was **Karnaugh maps.** As per, Kingsley did a good job of showing computational methods to solve problems that I traditionally would solve with pen and paper. Saying so, I think recently I've learnt to appreciate using paper more, as opposed to tech.

**Computing Project:** This week we learnt about **JavaScript** and **PHP**. I think Ramiz did a good job of touching a lot of the many bases of server side scripting languages.

**Summative Evaluation:** So, I felt like this week was more about turning up than it was about learning. I felt quite lethargic from the burnout and mental fatigue. Although, I'm ready to bounce back next week. Last week I discussed the idea of balancing work, and working too much. I realise now that I **have** to **work hard** in the **areas that matter**, I need to push my limits. My [goals](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/projects/goals) are massive, the only way to reach them is to perform at my full potential.

My first term of university has been a good trial run of a semester, I've had time to test a few different hobbies, techniques and mind sets. I have repeated it before, but university is about becoming who you want to be, not who you should be.
