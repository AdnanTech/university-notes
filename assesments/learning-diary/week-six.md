**Foundation Programming:** 

**Communication and Learning Skills:** During my research via the group project, Turing's paper taught me, in his own paper as well as research for the project, how important and how much of a required skill reducing ambiguous terms is.

This prompted me to thin k about the relationship between humans and machines.

**Summative Evaluation:**
