# Week six

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **string functions**. As iterated in previous weeks, the content itself was pretty **sraight forward**. However, the idea of **pointers** and **malloc** and how the **strings** functions **effect memory** was very interesting, as these kind of concepts are **hidden** from the user in **high level** languages as _garbage collection is automatic_ and built in. To summarise, learning _under the hood_ was the highlight of the week, as it can be some weeks.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week the idea was on **presentation skills**. During my research via the group project, _Turing's paper taught me_, as well as general research for the project, how **important** and how much of a required skill **reducing ambiguous terms** is, for engineering purposes and beyond. The engineering philosphy Turing used was to **have measurable tests** and then **test, test** and **test** more **until** you have to **improve** the **test benchmarks**. _Tests are crucial as they set benchmarks so you can measure milestones, improve the benchmarks, and raise the bar for the tests_. We can **apply** this **concept** to **revision techniques**. _If there is not a goal with the revision session, it would be like shooting an arrow with a bow and not knowing where the bullseye is that you are aiming for, you are hoping to achieve something that you do not even know if it is tangible._ 

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The focus this week was on **simultaneous equations**. The **content** was **straight forward**, as well as the maths **assignment** was **due** in **this week**. This was no worry as I had completed the work early on. However, I am well aware that the _first half of the semester is a lot easier than the second half_. I came to this conclusion earlier in the year by taking a quick glance of the module outline and **evaluating** the **concepts** covered in **each week**. As a result, I have _blocked out **more time**_ in maths for the **upcoming weeks**, for topics such as **matricies** and **MATLAB**.

**Computing Project:** This week the content was still **CSS**. This was **fine**, as repeated last week, _I have covered most of the content before but there are_ **small minute features** _of CSS I forget about or_ **have not been introduced** _to_, which primes me to **structure** my **CSS** code in **different**, more effecient ways in the future. We also were **assigned** our **project**, of which is a **report**, due for **week 9**. I_t should not be too bad as I can essentially cover Turing's paper, again, similar to content I have covered in CLS, essentially hitting two birds with one stone, to be more effecient in my learning._

In addition, we had lecture 2 of 3 on **Artificial Intelligence**. In which the lecture taught me that c_omputer science is \(a lot\) more than machines_, it hones in on **all sciences** and **combines** them, such as **psychology**, **philosophy** and **biology**, on top of the **core math** to build **technology**. This prompted me to think about the **relationship** between **humans** and **machines**. _With enough layers of abstraction, I actually think Turing's concept that humans can be seen as machines, applies as a truth_.

**Summative Evaluation:** This week was **managable** in terms of content. _Assessments are piling up_, so I must make sure I am on top of them, and making **testable progress**. I have compeltely **revamped** my personal **productivity system**, to be more **effecient** and to _cover more bases._ This helps me stay **organised** with the _different types of work_ I am undertaking \(university, side projects, helping my father with work, my job and freelancing\). **Details** on the revamping project can be **found** [**here**](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/projects/productivity-system/overview)**.** Details on the new workflow can be **found** [**here**]()**.**
