# Week six

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **string functions**. As iterated in previous weeks, the content itself was pretty sraight forward. However, the idea of pointers and malloc and how the strings functions effect memory was very interesting, as these kind of concepts are hidden from the user in high level languages as garbage collection is automatic and built in. So essentially, learning under the hood was the highlight of the week.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week the idea was on presentation skills. During my research via the group project, Turing's paper taught me, in his own paper as well as research for the project, how important and how much of a required skill reducing ambiguous terms is. For engineering purposes and beyond. Tests are good. Tests set benchmarks so you can improve the benchmarks.

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The focus this week was on **simultaneous equations**. The content was straight forward, as well as the maths assignment was due in this week. This was no worry as I had completed the work early on. However, I am well aware that the first half of the semester is a lot easier than the second half. I came to this conclusion by taking a quick glance of the module outline and evaluating the concepts covered in each week. As a result, I have blocked out more time in maths for the upcoming weeks.

**Computing Project:** This week the content consisted of CSS. This was fine, as repeated last week, I have covered most of the content before but there are small minute features of CSS I forget about or have not been introduced to, which primes me to structure my CSS code in different, more effecient ways in the future. We also were assigned our project, of which is a report, due for week 9. It shoudlnt be too bad as I can essentially cover Turing's paper, again, like I have in CLS.

In addition, we had lecture 2 of 3 on Artificial Intelligence. In which the lecture taught me that computer science is more than machines, it hones in on all sciences and combines them, such as psychology, philosophy and biology, on top of the core math and technology. This prompted me to thin k about the relationship between humans and machines.



**Summative Evaluation:**
