# Week eight

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **pointers.** This was interesting because like in previous weeks, the mention of C being close to metal \(hardware\) was mentioned. In that pointers can be stored in registers, which is faster than accessing variables, of which are stored in the RAM. In addition, I handed in my programming assignment. This was a big relief off my shoulders, as it is one less assignment to complete.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week we did x

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The agenda this week was differentiation. The content was fairly straight forward as I have experience with calculus from previous education. Although, I found it interesting to learn about the applications of differentiation throughout nature.

**Computing Project:** This week involved working on **building a website.** Whilst the idea was the code a dynamic website using php, since php is relatively new to me, I decided to first make work on creating the website statically, to validate the website architecture.

**Summative Evaluation:** This week was a good learning experience, as the workload was heavier than normal, with the new work project in progress as well as 3 assignments I wanted to make great progress with or complete. This meant vigorous planning, and staying disciplined to executing the task effeciently. As a result, the idea of focus capabiltiies came into play. How many hours can I focus in a day? How many hours do I usually focus for effectively? How many hours is the cut off point for diminishign returns? Can this be improved? I have written a comprehensive answer to this topic as a short page about in my notes on Notion.
