# Week eight

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **pointers.** This was interesting because like in previous weeks, the mention of C being close to metal \(hardware\) was mentioned. In that pointers can be stored in registers, which is faster than accessing variables, of which are stored in the RAM. In addition, I handed in my programming assignment.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week we did x

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The agenda this week was differentiation. This was fairly straight forward as I have experience with calculus from previous eductation

**Computing Project:** This week involved working on **building a website**
