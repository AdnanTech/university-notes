# Week eight

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **pointers.** This was interesting because like in previous weeks, the mention of C being close to metal \(hardware\) was mentioned. The pointers topic was interesting because it raises a lot of ideas about computer architecture, mainly being the stack and the heap. In addition, I handed in my programming assignment. This was a big relief off my shoulders, as it is one less assignment to complete. I am happy with the submission for this assignment, I believe I ticked off all the boxes on the brief, as well as becoming a better C programmer by building the project. We also got our second programming assignment, and i have added appropiate date and to do lists to my productivity system.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week we got our presentation results back, being 73/100. Whilst I was aiming for a mark in the 90 percent or above range, we can consider the different approach of this assignment, being group work. Since it was group work, perfect execution must not only come from yourself but also from your peers as well. Which can be unreliable, as chemistry between peers must be built over long periods of time. You also must take into account everyone's style and approach to the assigment. Saying all this, I am extremely **happy** with my **group peers**, they are a great bunch of people, who respected all ideas I put forward, and completed designated research tasks without fail, as well communicating properly to put forward agendas and plans.

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The agenda this week was differentiation. The content was fairly straight forward as I have experience with calculus from previous education. Although, I found it interesting to learn about the applications of differentiation throughout nature. The most intriguing application was one that Kingsley had briefly touched on in class, being financial trading algorithms. Working for small finance startup, it was especially interesting to hear this as if we abstract some layers from human behaviour, we can confidently say that the best algorithms built by traders, can be defined as a set of rules in which the trader created the algorithm, all based on differentiation. This means that if a machine uses all of the rules that were set to create the algorithm, it is no different to being a world class trader.

**Computing Project:** This week involved working on **building a website.** Whilst the idea was the code a **dynamic website using php**, since _php is relatively new to me_, I decided to **first** make work on **creating** the **website statically**, to validate the website architecture. Building the website statically is also less time consuming, which is important because I have _at least one_ **assignment** due **every week** up until the **end of term**, week 11.

In addition to the website, I have also completed the report assignment. Where I researched **web stacks** involved in **web development**, going into various examples, such as _the LAMP, MEAN and WISA web stacks_. I am happy with the turnout of my report, I think the biggest skills gained were learning how to reference effectively and being concise and meticulous with the content I am writing, paying great attention to detail due to the word limit.

**Summative Evaluation:** This week was a good learning experience, as the workload was heavier than normal, with the new work project in progress as well as 3 assignments I wanted to make great progress with or complete. This meant vigorous planning, and staying disciplined to executing the task effeciently. As a result, the idea of focus capabiltiies came into play. _How many hours can I focus in a day? How many hours do I usually focus for effectively? How many hours is the cut off point for diminishign returns? Can this be improved?_ I have written a comprehensive answer to this topic as a short page about in my notes on Notion. 

I also made slight adjustments to my workflow, which included having one page on notion where I can view all of my assingments, their due dates, their weight of the overall module course as well as the mark I have recieved in the assignment.
