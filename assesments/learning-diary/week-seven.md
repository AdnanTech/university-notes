# Week seven

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **refactoring code** as well as passing paramters **by value** and **by reference**. Although, the main focus this week was making significant progress on the programming project.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week we had our **presentation.** Execution of the presentation was fine for the most part. We were a little strapped for time, but managed to just about summarise the presentation in time. This was due to one of the sections taking double the amount of time than when we had practiced the presentation. Our group didn't account for this, so whilst a bumpy ride, it smoothed out in the end.

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** As discussed last week, the topics this week were matricies and MATLAB, two mostly new areas for me. As a result, I inteded to block out more time. However, due to assignments, as well as my workload from work increasing, I was unable to slot in the extra revision I had planned. I would like to add though that I believe the pre-reading I did, on top of in class consolidaiton means I do understand matricies. I would have just liked to practice some more if I had the time.

**Computing Project:** This week the content was still **building a website** using all the information we have learnt in class.

In addition, we had lecture 3 of 3 on **Artificial Intelligence**. In which the lecture taught me about systems.

**Summative Evaluation:** This week was **tougher than normal.** With my new work flow I know what needs to be done. It's a matter of finding the time and prioritising the assignments.
