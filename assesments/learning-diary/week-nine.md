# Week nine

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered **Files, Testing and Strings**. sdsadasd

Following up from last week, I asked Richard in an email to explain some of the differences between the stack and heap, as pointers are accessed within the stack and heap, as well as the benefits of modern compilers. To which Richard responded a very thorough and thoughout response. From Richard's response, I gathered that "_Heap variables are slower than stack variables. Stack variables have a name and may also be accessed by pointers. Heap variables do not have a name and so must be accessed by pointers. The heap is dynamic memory and must be allocated and freed explicitly by the programmer. The stack is limited in size and so programmers use the heap to store large items. We will not be covering dynamic memory allocation as our programs are very small and do not use much memory storage. My last array example from last week showed that by using pointers the number of variables copied is less. Modern compiles will alter our algorithms slightly to achieve the same result but with fewer variable copies. //TODO PARAPHRASE THIS_

_Fewer variable copies does mean faster execution, but that is also how modern compilers also help. When the compiler sees a small function it often inlines the code which cuts down on function calls and variable copying. Thus, we have the advantage of small function code which is easy to maintain and the compiler then reorganises it to make if fast //TODO PARAPHRASE THIS_

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week I gained an understanding in the methodology of writing technical documentation. The content was straight forward and digestable. It was a new topic, and writing concisely is likely one of my weakest areas, as a lot of my work and studying are logic based, not writing based. I also learnt that technical documents are vastly different to structured reports.

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The agenda this week was **more differentiation.** Which included **trigonmetry differentiation**, the **product** rule, the **quotient** rule, the **chain** rule and more **numerical method ways of differentiation** using _MATLAB_ and _Excel_. I already had a base knowledge of these rules and methods from prior education, but it was refreshing to hear them again, as there are a lot of rules to remember and use, even though they are only slight variations of one another. It was also reminded to us that t_he formula sheet containing most of the key equations will be given to us in our exam._

**Computing Project:** This week we learnt about some of the types of **images** that exist in the _digital world_. 

**Summative Evaluation:** This week was a nice learning experience, as the term is coming to a close and I can't wait to take my foot off the gas a little bit. I've been working hard all term to achieve the best results I can, and 

As well as making good progress academically throughout the week, I have made significant changes to my routine and lifestyle structure. To account for my sedentary lifestyle, I have now increased my exercising hours, throughout the week. Also, I have shifted my waking hours up, so I can get some deep, uninterrupted work and/or studying done in the early morning, whilst increasing the amount of time I am asleep, due to the effects that sleep deprivation can have on one's body. In addition, I now have a dedicated time slot in the morning for meditation, to benefit my health. Lastly, I have allocated a time slot after dinner to read a book with my younger brother.
