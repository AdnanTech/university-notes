# Week nine

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered Files, Testing and Strings.

Following up from last week, I asked Richard in an email to explain some of the differences between the stack and heap, as pointers are accessed within the stack and heap, as well as the benefits of modern compilers. To which Richard responded a very thorough and thoughout response. From Richard's response, I gathered that "_Heap variables are slower than stack variables. Stack variables have a name and may also be accessed by pointers. Heap variables do not have a name and so must be accessed by pointers. The heap is dynamic memory and must be allocated and freed explicitly by the programmer. The stack is limited in size and so programmers use the heap to store large items. We will not be covering dynamic memory allocation as our programs are very small and do not use much memory storage. My last array example from last week showed that by using pointers the number of variables copied is less. Modern compiles will alter our algorithms slightly to achieve the same result but with fewer variable copies. //TODO PARAPHRASE THIS_

_Fewer variable copies does mean faster execution, but that is also how modern compilers also help. When the compiler sees a small function it often inlines the code which cuts down on function calls and variable copying. Thus, we have the advantage of small function code which is easy to maintain and the compiler then reorganises it to make if fast //TODO PARAPHRASE THIS_

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week 

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The agenda this week was **more differetiation.** Which included the product rule, the quotient rule, the chain rule and more numerical method ways of differentiation using MATLAB.

**Computing Project:** This week involved 

**Summative Evaluation:** This week was a good learning experience, as 

As well as making good progress academically throughout the week, I have made significant changes to my routine and lifestyle structure. To account for my sedentary lifestyle, I now get in some exercise first thing in the morning, everyday. Also, I have shifted my waking hours up, so I can get some deep, uninterrupted work done in the early morning, whilst increasing the amount of time I am asleep, due to the effects that sleep deprivation can have on one's body. In addition, I now have a dedicated time slot in the morning for meditation, to benefit my health. Lastly, I have allocated a time slot after dinner to read a book with my younger brother.
