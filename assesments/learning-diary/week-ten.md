# Week ten

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered complex **File functions** and **character arithmetic** and **character functions.** The content was fine, to be honest I **zoned out** for the lectures this week, as I have the **programming assignment** due next week, and _the content was basically the same as last week, as I figured out from pre reading the lecture notes_. The main objective set out for the lectures was to **understand** the **code** so that the **assignment** becomes **easier**.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week we had an overview of the **portfolio assignment**. I also made **progress** with the **PDP** documents, and started **assessing** the **skills audit** and my **goals** I set at the start of term.

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** The agenda this week was **logic gates** and **binary number systems.** I also submitted the maths coursework. Content wise, lo_gic gates was pretty straight forward due to prior exposure_. Similar to previous topics however, Kingsley does a good job of **presenting numerical solutions** to problems that I have not witnessed before. This included **using Excel** to **create** compeltely legit **truth tables**. 

**Computing Project:** This week we learnt about **eBusinesses** and **eCommerce**. Whilst _nothing new_, it was **refreshing** to **hear** some of the **terms** to do **with** the **eCommerce** world. Saying so, _I found myself not paying a lot of attention in class, as a result my mind would wonder a bit_.

**Summative Evaluation:** Honestly, this week I **felt terrible**. Although _I learnt a lot about myself and my values, as well as being very grateful for the opportunity to have a very work focused semester_, pushing the limits of my **potential**, I've started to **burnout** and I have a whole term to go of this year, let alone 3 more years. I think I'm in **dire need of a recalibration of my trajectory**, which I intend to carry out next week. _I think a big part of reaching my fullest potential in every situation, is sustainability. I don't have that sustainability to do that, when I become a workhorse_.

Part of this recalibration should be about **acceptance of good work**, that is **not perfect**, so I have _more time to do the things I love and enjoy, hence the lack of content in the learning diary this week_. I also want **clear cut visions** \(focused\) instead of goals, an **enhanced reward system** and to be a lot **more physically active**. I feel as if my **mind** has started to become **unhealthy** from the **overworking lifestyle**. So I'll **adjust** and **keep moving forward.**
