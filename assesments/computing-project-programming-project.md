# Computing Project Programming Project

## Idea

### Project Title

CSC4 - A fully fledged, innovative, customised SaaS ePOS system

### Brief Description

CSC4 \(Convenience Store Companion 4\) is a fully fledged SaaS \(Software As A Service\) ePOS \(electronic Point Of Sales\) system with new, innovative functionality, such as the ability to: read a wholesalers receipt and automatically add the items into the stock, view a heat map of the current stock avalible in the store to see which items need to be re-stocked, detailed statistics to see which days and time in the month are the most profitable. On top of the core POS stack that includes: Inventory management \(process stock information, stock lookup\) and User accounts and permissions.

### Aim\(s\) and Objectives

The aim is to replace the current old and outdated POS system that my Grandmother's shop currently uses, with a new, more sleek looking and functioning POS system. This means combining my knowledge of databases, object oriented programming, artificial intelligence and potentially web devleopment to make a fluid and interactive solution stack. Objectives can be defined as the functionality listed in the brief description above.

The 4 of CSC4 comes from the number of key functionality the program has:

* Inventory management
* User accounts and permissions
* Deep inventory analysis statististical viewing
* Use of computer vision to make the wholesalers re-stocking process more effecient

### Computing Area

The Project has elements of a few computing areas:

* Digital Media \(it's essentially a CRUD \(Create, Read, Update, Delete\) application that uses an SQL database\)
* Artificial Intelligence \(OCR of wholesalers receipts to input new stock items into stock\)
* **Indirect** e-commerce \(not 'true' e-commerce, but I will have to purchase a physical card reader, as well as log transactions and the transaction type\)
* **Potential** web development \(idea of creating a quick ASP.NET website to display database information is on the table\)

### Resource\(s\)

Assuming resources means hardware:

* Computer \(any OS, mini desktop\)
* Touchscreen monitor \(no kb&m\)
* Cash drawer
* Scanner
  * Paper scanner - wholesalers receipts
  * Barcode scanner - item scanner
* Receipt printer
* Customer display monitor
* Credit card reader

Whilst I would have like to been funded for the project, I have no obligations paying for the hardware myself. I intend to buy the hardware as need it, so I can mainly focus on the software side of things. I do see driver compatability being an possible issue, but I will tackle that hurdle when I get there.

### Programming Language\(s\)

There are 2 avenues I can take to build the project, let's talk about the meta programming side of things first. Both projects require object oriented capabilities as well as use of the TensorFlow library for the computer vision side of the project.

As for the language choice of the application, the options are:

1. I can use the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) platform to build the GUI application, which uses C++ code and does a lot of the heavy lifting for me. C++ is new to me so this would be a fun but challenging route to take. Benefits of Qt is that it's fast, scalable and cross platform.
2. I can use the Windows Forms library, that is part of the .NET framework to create a C\# GUI application. This approach will use a lot of familiar techniques I have used, but for that reason, will not be very challenging. Hence I am leaning towards the first option. The limitations of this option is also that the OS will have to be based on Windows.

Obviously I'll also need SQL and potentially web development languages \(HTML, CSS, jQuery/JavaScript and C\#\)

## Notes

* Two presentations
* Asterix means it counts towards the word count
* It's a report, not a tech doc
* First presentation is early February
* Second presentation is mid may - report is also due then
* Practically the same brief as the third year project
