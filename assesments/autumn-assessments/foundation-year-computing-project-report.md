## Reading list

## [What is a web stack?](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Web-stack)

A web stack is a collection of software required for Web development. At a minimum, a Web stack contains an operating system \([OS](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/operating-system-OS)\), a programming language, database software and a [Web server](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Web-server).

[LAMP](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/LAMP-Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) is one commonly used Web stack. It uses [Linux](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/Linux-operating-system) as the operating system, [Apache](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Apache) as the Web server, [MySQL](https://searchoracle.techtarget.com/definition/MySQL) as the relational database management system and [PHP](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/PHP-Hypertext-Preprocessor) as the object-oriented scripting language. 

A Web stack is one type of [solution stack](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/solution-stack) -- an ordered collection of software that performs a particular task.

## Uses

Web stacks are used to create complex web applications

## The stacks

Talk about the differences, uses and such

* The **LAMP** stack is the foundation for Linux hosted websites is the **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL and **P**HP \(LAMP\) software stack.
* * The **WISA** stack is the foundation for Windows hosted websites is the **W**indows, **I**IS, **M**ySQL and **A**SP.net \(WISA\) software stack.

## The layers

OS based web servers consist of four software components. These components, arranged in layers supporting one another, make up the software stack. Websites and Web Applications run on top of this underlying stack. The common software components that make up a traditional **LAMP**, **WAMP**, **MAMP** and **WISA** stack are:

_OS \(Linux\Windows\MacOS\):_ The operating system \(OS\) makes up our first layer. OS sets the foundation for the stack model. All other layers run on top of this layer.

_Apache:_ The second layer consists of web server software, which is Apache Web Server. This layer resides on top of the Linux layer. Web servers are responsible for translating from web browsers to their correct website.

_Internet Information Service \(IIS\):_ The second layer consists of web server software, which is IIS. IIS is a manageable, secure and flexible service that is crucial for web hosting anything on the web. One can enable IIS on the computer operating on Windows 10.

_MySQL:_ Our third layer is where databases live. MySQL stores details that can be queried by scripting to construct a website. MySQL usually sits on top of the Linux layer alongside Apache/layer 2. In high end configurations, MySQL can be off loaded to a separate host server.

_PHP:_ Sitting on top of them all is our fourth and final layer. The scripting layer consists of PHP and/or other similar web programming languages. Websites and Web Applications run within this layer.
