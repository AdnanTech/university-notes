# SMART Goals

## SMART Goals

Below are the SMART goals I am looking to achieve, based on these [categories](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/wiki/categories-of-life). There is currently no priority to these goals, this is something I intend to add in the future.

      <td style="text-align:center">Sub 10 mins is athlete level, so I need to be be careful not to injure
        myself by overtraining and make sure I am resting adquately</td>
      <td style="text-align:center">So that my cognitive abilites stay sharp and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcQ5ZojGw8">fluid IQ decreases slower over time</a>,

        how much of them are beneficial towards achieving my short term and long
