### Pre-Lab Notes

### Post-Lab Notes

3 Sections to the workshop:

1. Thinking about measuring visual acuity and how that relates to receptive field sizes
   1. Size of receptive fields determine the smallest objects we can see
2. How to non-linear properties of receptive fields contribute to perception
   1. Retinal gangilion cells, second layer of visual system after the photoreceptors
   2. emphasises on what you can see and throws away everything else
   3. Use the Mach Bands model to explain why we see certain aspects of visual images being enhanced
3. How do visual neurons adapt over time
   1. Displayed using visual illusions, to sow receptive field properties of a particular cell aren't fixed, and they adapt to recent history of the experiences they've recieved



## Worksheet

Receptive fields of visual cells are measured in angles, because objects might take up the same size in your visual receptors but be different in size and distance.

### Part 1

1.1 Answer is 0.5 for both using that equation.

1.2 Thinking about the smallest theoretical object we can see is, since it is dependant on the size of receptive fields of photoreceptors we look at photoreceptors in the eye. Our visual cones are single photoreceptors that contribute to your vision. So we need to look at visual cones, which brings us to the image of the back of a retina with visual cones. So we need to calculate the angle. There are 5 cones across the scale bar, meaning the diameter of a cone is 0.002 mm, 0.01 / 5 (size). We also know the eye is 17mm deep (distance). The answer is a small angle out, but we times this by 60 because the answer is in minutes of arc.

1.3 We can measure our visual acuity using the Landolt-C test. Landolt PDF on screen, measure distance to screen when you can't see C's gap, and then measure inbetween C's on a specific row, to find the gap, which in this case is the size. Then use 1.1 equation to solve. The answer should be similar to 1.2. Meaning to detect these gaps you are only using 2 or 3 photoreceptors to percieve the gap.

### Part 2

2.1 The retinal ganglion cells adds up output from some photoreceptors and subtracts the outputs of other photoreceptors, thus emphasises what you need to see. This is called lateral inhibition, or an "on centre of surround"

![If light hit the on area, the cell becomes excited, the opposite is true (de-excitement) for when light hits the off area.](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png>)

* If light falls on both regions, there is a cancellation of activity, nor excitement or inhibition.
* If light falls on all of the center but not all of the surround, there would still be more excitation because although some excitation is cancelled out by the inhibiton, not all of the inhibition is present and thus the excitation prevails in strength, exciting the cells.

**Mach band illusion**

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (197).png>)

The mach band illusion is where essentially we create shadows out of thin air. These rectangles dont actually have any shadows, but your eyes give each rectangle a darker shadow to the left, and a lighter shadow to the right. Creating this illusion of a colour palette almost, **emphasising the boundaries of the different colours**.

For the calculations:

the example he gives is solving B: light level 1, left edge is -1 so we have -1x1 for the left edge, that's 1. middle is +4, so +4 x 1. Right edge is -1, but because it's in the second light level it is x2, therefore -2. Leaving us with -1 + 4 -2 = 1.

So as the retinal ganglion cells move from A to B, the right edge went to the light area. so the right edge gets more inhibition, so the overall response goes down, even though we are entering a brighter area.

for C: left is -1x1. middle is +4x2. Left edge is -1x2 = 5.

Conclusion: jumps in output are large, but the output decreases as intensity increases.

Retinal Ganglion cells emphasise the change in light intensity, as we can see from ther jumps, but the decreases show us that the accuracy of coding the light intensity itself.

### Part 3

Optical illusion with magneta circles, with one that dissapears and turns into green circles if you fixate on it. we have 3 RGB cones each responding to it's respective colour (red, green blue). Lilac stimulates the blue and the red photoreceptors, but not the green. The neurons that make the lilac become fatigued. So over time the response will drop, but we still percieve it as lilac because they're dropping at the same rate. So the empty slot is always percieved as green because the red and blue cones are so exhausted.



1. Look at stimulus A
   1. Grey background
2. Fatigue component X with prolonged activation
   1. Fatigue S and L wavelength cones
3. Look again at stimulus A
   1. Background appears greenish
4. If perception of A has changed, then component X is needed for the normal perception of A
   1. S and L wavelength cones are needed to percieve grey

By fatiguing elements of the population of sensors the balance of perception temporarily.
