## Central Nervous System (CNS)

Refers to the brain and the spinal cord, consists of a bone protection layer, Three meninges that have cerebral spinal fluid in (CSF)

### Spinal Cord Nerves

Sensory information is afferent, and comes via the Dorset roots

Motor information leaves in the ventral roots, being efferent.

## Resting Membrane Potential

A key idea of the (resting) cell membrane is that electrons can move across when excited using ion channels/ion pumps.

## Changes in Potential

## Action Potential

Gated Channels, Voltage-sensitive ion channels

## Myelin

Used for muscle memory, and to transmit signals across axons

## Peripherral Nervous System (PNS)

Refers to neurons outside of the CNS. Any signals outside of the CNS being input are called afferent, whereas if they are output from the CNS they are called Efferent.

## Cerebral Cortex

Folded so it can fit inside the skull, called the cerebrum, which is basically all of the brain. The folds are called sulci (Sulcus singular). The smooth regions in between are called gyri (Gyrus singular).

## Neuron are Excitable

Biological electricity can charge ions and stuff. Is a math equation, read more into it.

## Resting Membrane Potential

Neurons can have different resistances, and reflect how open an ion channel is. Low resistance implies open channels. Lots of brain chemistry going on here, with positive and negative ions.

Resting membrane potential can be referred to as the electrical Potential difference, a resting membrane potential typically has -70mV.

## ATP

Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) pumps sodium out of a cell, and potassium ions into the cell against their concentration gradient. This is a law of equivalent exchange, where energy is lost.

## Ion channels

Each channel has their own role in interacting with neuons. IMPORTANT FOR EXAM

1. Leak Channels: Occassionaly let an inside to outside transaction to occur.
2. Ligand-Gated channels: A small molecule attaches to a large molecule to complete a transaction
3. Voltage-sensitive channels
