# Mammalian Nervous System

Carlson (2017) Physiology of Behavior - QU 4588 Car EBook





## Central Nervous System (CNS)

Refers to the brain and the spinal cord, consists of a bone protection layer, Three meninges that have cerebral spinal fluid in (CSF)

### Spinal Cord Nerves

Sensory information is afferent, and comes via the Dorset roots

Motor information leaves in the ventral roots, being efferent.

## Resting Membrane Potential

A key idea of the (resting) cell membrane is that electrons can move across when excited using ion channels/ion pumps.

## Changes in Potential

## Action Potential

Gated Channels, Voltage-sensitive ion channels

## Myelin

Used for muscle memory, and to transmit signals across axons

## Peripherral Nervous System (PNS)

Refers to neurons outside of the CNS. Any signals outside of the CNS being input are called afferent, whereas if they are output from the CNS they are called Efferent.

## Cerebral Cortex

Folded so it can fit inside the skull, called the cerebrum, which is basically all of the brain. The folds are called sulci (Sulcus singular). The smooth regions in between are called gyri (Gyrus singular).

## Neuron are Excitable

Biological electricity can charge ions and stuff. Is a math equation, read more into it.
