# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Learning Outcomes

* Evidence knowledge of a variety of data structures in terms of their characteristic behaviours.
* Demonstrate basic knowledge of complexity issues with respect to data manipulation.
* Evidence understanding of a number of fundamental algorithms.

## Outline

This module provides an introduction to data structures and algorithms for computer scientists. The module introduces a number of fundamental data structures, including arrays linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables and graphs. These are presented both abstractly, via the notion Abstract Data Types, and concretely in terms of their implementation in an object-oriented framework. The data structures are discussed and analysed in terms of efficiency of the basic operations they support and their application to program design problems. Consideration is given to important, fundamental algorithms for searching and sorting data.
