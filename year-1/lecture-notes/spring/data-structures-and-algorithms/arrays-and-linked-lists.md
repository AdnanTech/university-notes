# Arrays

Arrays are xyz

## Arrays vs Linked Lists

define linked list and talk about differences

## Singly Linked Lists

Has nodes that keep track of the "head" and "tail" of a data set.

## Implementing a Singly Linked List Class

insert code block

## Circularly Linked Lists

In real life, there might not be a first to last linear sequence. Instead, it may loop around once last has been executed. For example, in a video game, Player A takes a turn, Player B and then Player C. Until the game is complete, it must loop back around to Player A's turn once Player C has finished his turn. This is called having a **cyclic order**, running on a continours loop.

## Doubly Linked-Lists

we define a linked list in which each node keeps an explicit reference to the node before it and a reference to the node after it. Such a structure is known as a doubly linked list. These lists allow a greater variety of O(1)-time update operations, including insertions and deletions at arbitrary posi- tions within the list
