# Intro to DSA

The IDE we use is IntelliJ. Module is around 150 houirs of workload, that intends to cover data structures and algorithms. In this module, data structures are one or more systematic ways of organising and accessing data. An algorith, is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem in a finite amount of time.

## History of Algorithms

Deriving from the persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn Mūsā al’Khwārizmī, his latinized name translating to Algoritmi. Then Euclid devised an **algorithm** to idenitfy the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Then Nicomachus of Gerasa created the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which helps identify prime numbers and is used even today when teaching maths.

## Splitting the module into two

#### Data Structures:

* Linear
  * Arrays
    * Maps
    * Hashes
  * Stacks
  * (Priority) Queues
  * Linked Lists
* Non Linear
  * Trees (Binary Heap)
  * Graphs

**Algorithms:**

* Search
* Sorting
* Tree Traversal
* Graoh Traversak
* Shortest Paths
* Cycle Detection in Graphs

## Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures

| Basis for Comparison   | Linear                                                                   | Non-Linear                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic                  | Arranged in an orderly manner where the elements are attached adjacently | Arranged ina sorted order and there exists a relationship between the data elements |
| Traversing of the Data | Can be accessed one time, so in a single run                             | Cannot traverse in one go/impossible                                                |
| Ease of Implementation | Simpler                                                                  | Complex                                                                             |
| Levels involved        | Single level                                                             | Multi-level                                                                         |
| Memory Utilisation     | Ineffective                                                              | Effective                                                                           |
