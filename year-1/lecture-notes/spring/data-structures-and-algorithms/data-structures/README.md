# Data Structures

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is defined by their behaviour not by their implementation. This is not the case for 'normal' data types, which are defined by how they are implemented.

In Java, ADTs are defined through Interfaces. Think of a Java interface as a ‘contract’ of what can be done with the data structure and how it will behave (but not implementation specific)
