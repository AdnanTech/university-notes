# Non Linear

Non Linear data structures stores the elements non-sequentially. They link elemnts together using multiple paths, meaning they can be anywhere in the memory and still be in a kind of "order". The upside is that they utilise memory more effeciently than non-linear, but the downside is that they cannot traverse the elements in a single run. They use multi-level storage and are more complex to implement. Examples include Trees, Graphs, Binary Search Trees and Binary Heaps.
