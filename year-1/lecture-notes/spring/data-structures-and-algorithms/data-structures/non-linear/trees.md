## The Tree Abstract Data Type

## Binary Trees

## The Binary Tree Abstract Data Type

provide solution to storing entries of an ordered map ◦ Support searching for keys ◦ Update operations straightforward, though non-trivial

## Properties of Binary Trees

Performance of search, etc. proportional to height of tree ◦ Can achieve O(log 2 n) ◦ Worst case O(n)

## Implementing Trees

## Tree Traversal Algorithms

## Preorder and Postorder Traversals of General

## Trees

## Breadth-First Tree Traversal

## Inorder Traversal of a Binary Tree

## AVL Trees

* binary search trees&#x20;
* height balance property&#x20;
  * Ensure O(log n) height&#x20;
* restructure tree after insertions to restore balance
* Need to consider a number of different cases o rotations
