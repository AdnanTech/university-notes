## Graph Traversals

### Depth-First Search

### Breadth-First Search

### DFS vs BFS

## Directed Acyclic Graphs

## Weighted Graphs

### Shortest Paths



### A\*

A\* Summary&#x20;

A\* finds the shortest path between two vertices

It does not have to visit all vertices to do this necessarily, hopefully

It picks the most promising looking node at each step

It is only as good as its heuristic- and heuristics are problem specific

List of open nodes can be priority queue as with Dijkstra'

### Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
