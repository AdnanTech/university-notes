# Inheritance

* Superclass
* Overriding - can inherit a method but override a new method with the same method signature,  to become a different method.
* Inheritance hierarchy can be seen as a tree
* Abstraction allows you to ignore fine details to look at a higher level picture
  * Inheritance plays off of abstraction to create classes with shared characteristics
* Inheritance supports modularisation
* Key term of inheritance is **extend**

Advantages of Inheritance

* Avoiding code duplication
* Enhancing code reuse (sub-class, then override as needed)
* Easier maintenance (clear structure)
* Extendability

## Access Control

Access control refers to public and private qualifiers.

Protected is another qualifier that classes and subclasses can utilise, but any classes outside of the package cannot access it. You should use accessor methods as a substitute for protected qualifiers.



Classes can be grouped into packages for reusability, better organisation and to avoid naming conflicts. You can create new packages in intelliJ.

## Subtypes

Subtyping is polymorphism basically. So Inheritance with value.

Polymorphic collections: ArrayLists, Hashmaps
