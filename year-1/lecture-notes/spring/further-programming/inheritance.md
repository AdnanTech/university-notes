# Inheritance

* Superclass
* Overriding - can inherit a method but override a new method with the same method signature,  to become a different method.
* Inheritance hierarchy can be seen as a tree
* Abstraction allows you to ignore fine details to look at a higher level picture
  * Inheritance plays off of abstraction to create classes with shared characteristics
* Inheritance supports modularisation
* Key term of inheritance is **extends**
