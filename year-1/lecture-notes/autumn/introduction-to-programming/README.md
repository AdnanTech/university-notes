# Introduction to Programming

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand and successfully carry out the edit-compile-run cycle of software development in an appropriate software development environment.
* Understand and use fundamental programming concepts such as variables, conditional statements, looping constructs, and methods \(procedures\).
* Appreciate the distinction between objects and primitive types in Java.
* Write a simple Java application involving about half a dozen or so simple classes.
* Understand the basics of object oriented concepts such as encapsulation.
* Understand and make use of simple built in data-types such as arrays, Strings, and some of the Collection classes.

## Outline
