# Introduction to the Module

## Why Java?

Java was designed with internet applications in mind. It's also an object oriented language. Most importantly, its "architecturally neutral and portable", meaning it'll run on any operating system.

## The Structure of Java

Java is structured in a modular fashion so other packages can be imported into Java projects.
