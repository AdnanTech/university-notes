## Basic Operations

Basic operations counts as the arithmetic operations as well as control flow.

## Purpose of algorithms



## Essential features of algorithms

* Non self-referential

## Data storage - Variables



## Data storage - Arrays



## Control structures 



## Direct Sequencing 



## Conditional Sequencing 



## Layout is important

When writing pseudocode, the indentation matters a lot as it shows which variables are within scope.

## Bounded iteration



## Conditional iteration



## Calculating salary bill

### Problem description

Legal inputs: any list of employee records, containing each of their salaries 

Required output: the total salary bill

### Algorithm

* Make a note of the number zero
* For each employee in the list, add their salary to the noted number
* Output the noted number

## Happy employees



## Towards pseudocode



## Algorithm Example: Multiplication A La Russe

To program this, you would use bitwise shifts.
