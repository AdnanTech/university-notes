# Intro To Algorithms

## Algorithms

**An algorithm consists of an ordered list of basic operations, which for every valid input:**

* Determines a **finite sequence of basic operations** to be performed
* Halts - Given an input, will the algorithm hang or go into an infinite loop?
* Produces some output

An Algorithm is a "_recipe for a system to carry out a task_" - Named after al-Khwarizmi – 7th century Persian mathematician

### Defining an Algorithm

To be an algorithm, you must meet certain requirements:

* Contain only **basic operations** must be _elementary and unambiguous_ – require no creativity and _understandable by system_ executing the algorithm
* Level of detail appropriate to system executing the algorithm

If the output contains the same elements as the input, it's a **permutation**, where there are the same elements, that is achieved by swapping. This terminology is commonly used in sorting algorithms.

## Algorithm Properties

Important properties of algorithms are **correctness** and **complexity**. The concept of time complexity of an algorithm is presented and **asymptotic complexity classes** will be covered.

**Correctness** covers how accurage the algorithm is to it's specification, is each input leading to the correct output? Whereas complexity covers resource cost and effeciency.

## Specification

A specification describes **WHAT** a system needs to do, expressed in meaningful \(layman\) terms to the **USER** of the system. This needs to be independant of any details of how the **SYSTEM** works.

## Computation

A computation is a form of a calculation, either using arithmetics or non-arithmetical. A computer is a device that performs calculations.

## System

A system is a physical process that can carry out a range of tasks, common systems are:

* Computer
* Web service
* Assembly Plant \(DVDs, Cars, Rockets\)
* Weaving Machine \(Carpets, Clothes\)
* Cooking Machine
* Home Help \(Roomba\)

## Implementation

Implementation and specifacation are examples of **task descriptions**.

* Implementation is a detailed description of the various steps in the system that must be performed to carry out the task.
* Specification is a high level external description of the task, what is the task.

For example, a specification might be to make a chocolate cake. Whereas the implementation for this is the steps required to bake the cake, so crack the eggs, mix, flour, oven bake etc.

## Large & Small Undertakings

Programming in the large often consists of large complex systems, many modules, many tools and many programmers. On the contrast, programming in small means a one man well defined, algorithmic problem. On this course, only small is covered.

## Algorithmic Problems

For a problem to be algorithmic, it needs to have:

* Up to an infinite amount of **inputs**, as well as a required **output,**which is a function of the inputs.

For example, if you are given a set of numbers, and you are asked to find the largest number in the set, this is an algorithmic problem
