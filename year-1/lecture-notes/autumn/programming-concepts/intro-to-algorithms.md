# Intro To Algorithms

## Module Overview

The description of algorithmic problems•

* Their solution using algorithms
* The design of algorithms

The comparison between different algorithms for the same problem

* How do we choose between them?
* When is one algorithm better than another?

Reasoning about algorithms

* Does the algorithm solve the given problem?
* In all cases?
* How can we guarantee this?

## Algorithm Properties

Important properties of algorithms are **correctness** and **complexity**. The concept of time complexity of an algorithm is presented and **asymptotic complexity classes** will be covered.

## Specification

A specification describes **WHAT** a system needs to do, expressed in meaningful terms \(layman\) to the **USER** of the system. This needs to be independant of any details of how the **SYSTEM** works.

## System

A system is a physical process that can carry out a range of tasks, common systems are:

* Computer
* Web service
* Assembly Plant \(DVDs, Cars, Rockets\)
* Weaving Machine \(Carpets, Clothes\)
* Cooking Machine
* Home Help \(Roomba\)

## Implementation

Implementation and specifacation are examples of **task descriptions**.

* Implementation is a detailed description of the various steps in the system that must be performed to carry out the task.
* Specification is a high level external description of the task, what is the task.

For example, a specification might be to make a chocolate cake. Whereas the implementation for this is the steps required to bake the cake, so crack the eggs, mix, flour, oven bake etc.

## Large & Small Undertakings

Programming in the large often consists of large complex systems, many modules, many tools and many programmers. On the contrast, programming in small means a one man well defined, algorithmic problem. On this course, only small is covered.

## Algorithmic Problems

For a problem to be algorithmic, it needs to have up to an infinite amount of inputs, as well as a required output. For example, if you are given a set of numbers, and you are asked to find the largest number in the set, this is an algorithmic problem

## Algorithms

An algorithm consists of an ordered list of basic operations, which for every valid input:

* Determines a finite sequence of operations to be performed
* Halts
* Produces some output

"_Recipe for asystemto carry out a task_" - Named after al-Khwarizmi – 7th century Persian mathematician

To be an algorithm, you must meet certain requirements:

* Basic operations must be elementary and unambiguous – require no creativity
* Understandable by system executing the algorithm
* Level of detail appropriate to system executing the algorithm
