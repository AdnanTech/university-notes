# Discipline Matures: Three Landmarks

## Prehistory of Cognitive Science

### Cognitive Science vs. Behaviourism

**Behaviourism** - Psychological movements sharing the assumption that psychologists should concern themselves with **observable phenomena** and **measurable behaviour**. All learning is either **reinforcement learning** or **classical conditioning.**

Behaviourism assumes all learning is the result of **conditioning**, and conditioning depends upon processes of **association** and **reinforcement**. e.g. Pavlov's dogs being conditioned to salivate at the sound of a dinner bell, and the Skinner Box, in which a rat becomes conditioned to perform behaviour with rewards and punishments.

**Classical Conditioning** - Strengthening of association between a  conditioned stimulus \(the ringing of a bell\), and an unconditioned stimulus \(presentation of food\) resulting in a behavioural response \(salivation\). 

### Tolman and Honzik, "'Insight' in Rats" \(1930\)

Tolman and Honzik disprove the notion that all learning is reinforced or conditioned through experiments on rats navigating mazes.

#### The Experient

Three groups of rats are made to navigate a maze. The first group receive rewards each time they successfully navigate the maze, the second receive no reward and the third are unrewarded for the first ten days.

#### The Results

The first group, motivated by food, learn to solve the maze as expected by the concept of behaviourism. The second and third groups seemed to wander aimlessly. Once rewarded, the third group manage to solve the maze faster than the first. 

The third group, Tolman and Honzik argue, must have memorised the layout of the maze despite having no reward, and thus, no reinforcement.

### Tolman, Ritchie, and Kalish, "Studies in Spacial Learning" \(1946\)

\*\*\*\*[**Spacial Learning**](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1428-6_44) **\(cognitive mapping, spatial memory\)** - refers to the process by which an organism acquires a mental representation of its environment. 

The experiment found that it was easier for animals to code spatial information in terms of places rather than in terms of particular sequences of movements. 

### Lashley, "The Problem of Serial Order in Behavior" \(1951\)

Complex behaviour can only be thought about in the previous two experiments as sequences of functions taking place one after another. Lashley argues that this is not the case and that behaviour is arranged hierarchically rather than linearly.

Complex behaviour should be thought about as the product of prior planning and organisation. Even simple plans can be broken down into even simpler ones. Despite being conscious of a high-level plan, most of the information processing happens at a subconscious level \(**subconscious information processing**\). 

The hypothesis of task analysis states that we can understand a complex system by breaking it down into subtasks. e.g. The memory system could be divided into subtasks for storing and retrieving information. Further down the hierarchy, the subtask for storing could be divided further into sub-subtasks for long and short-term storage.
