# Beginnings

## Overview

The course is basically a cognitive science course, so the **science of the mind**. Some key questions:

* What is the mind?
* How does it work?
* Can machines have minds, or even think?
* Where are its boundaries?
* What is the difference between the mind and the brain?
* How is behaviour controlled?

Some key pillars of _early_ cognitive science, which later on became key pillars of the _mind_:

The ones in bold actually encapsulate behaviorist psychology.

* **Environment**
* **Behaviour**
* **Serial Unconscious Processing**
* Task Analysis and hierarchical systems
* Formal Analysis of language
* Internal info storage and Representation
* Computation/Algorithm
* Information Processing

Cognitive psychology precursors goes all the way back to around 400 BC, with Plato, and properly started in 1956AD with the symposium on information theory.

## Philosophical Zombies

Imagine a perfect copy of yourself, perfect down to the last atom. It looks, and acts in the exact way you would. However, it is not a conscious being. Is the existence of a P Zombie conceivable?&#x20;

## Meno - "Learning is recollection of knowledge"

The meno dialogue refers to a conversation had between Plato and Meno regarding innate knowledge. Innate knowledge refers to knowledge held by an individual from the moment they were born, for example, knowing how to breathe, reflexes made by babies and such. Plato argues that all knowledge is innate.&#x20;
