#### Think of some examples of activities that require intelligence to do.  Can they be described in problem representation terms, including a start state, operators to transform states and test conditions for a goal?

Playing a game of chess requires intelligence. The board has a start state with all the pieces in place, players move the pieces to transform the state of the board and a queen being taken is the test condition of the goal. 



#### Divide and conquer is a common problem-solving heuristic.  Can you think of any others?  (Hint â€“ pick some complex problems and reflect on how you would attempt to solve them.)

* Trial and error e.g. Going to isles randomly or using intuition until you find the item
* Profiling e.g. Asking a store assistant to help find an item in a shop
* Stereotyping
* 'Rule-of-thumb'
* Intuition e.g. Solving a Captcha 

#### Explain in your own words why the Chinese/Russian room argument is an objection to taking the Turing Test to reveal genuine intelligence.

What can be mistaken for intelligence could simply be a complex algorithmic sequence.
