# Introduction to Programming

## Learning Outcomes

* Demonstrate knowledge of fundamental imperative programming concepts such as variables and assignment, conditional statements, loops and methods.
* Code an application in a suitable object-oriented programming language, from a detailed software specification.
* Evidence knowledge of basic concepts and principles of object-orientation such as objects and classes, encapsulation, object state, coupling, cohesion and modularity.
* Show awareness of basic principles of software design and development including appropriate naming of variables and classes, code lay out, testing and debugging, and documentation.

## Outline

This module provides an introduction to programming concepts and techniques, as well as elementary software development principles. Both for absolute beginners and for those with prior programming experience, the module introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, including: classes and objects, variables and assignment, primitive and object types, methods, control structures, collections, iteration and recursion. The module also provides an introduction to basic software development issues such as class design, testing, debugging and documentation.

## Technical Requirements

* A desktop PC or Laptop
