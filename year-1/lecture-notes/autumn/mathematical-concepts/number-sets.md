## What is a number

## ℕatural Numbers

ℕ stands for a **natural** number. A natural number is any number that  
 may be obtained from 0, by applying the “successor function” `[S(n)=n+1]`  
 a finite number of times. If 0 is not included, one might write  
 N\_+ … or more often: Z\_+

This encapsulates {0,1,2,3...} as well as the operations. A general rule of thumb is that if you  add or multiply two natural numbers, the result is another natural number.

ℕ is closed under addition and multiplication”. ℕ is not closed under subtraction or division: 3−5∉ℕ and 1/3∉ℕ.

## ℤ

ℤ stands for **integers**

This involves { …, -2, -1, 0, 1,2, … }. Unlike ℕ, the integers ℤ are closed under subtraction, because it contains negative numbers. But, something is lost… There is no ‘first’ integer, which gives you the rest by applying the successor function; and the sum / product of two numbers, can be smaller than one or both of them.

## ℚ

ℚ stands for **rational** numbers, so fractions.

ℚ is all numbers that can be written in the form 𝑎/𝑏, where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are integers: 𝑎,𝑏∈ ℤ \(but 𝑏 ≠ 0\). 𝑎= “numerator”, 𝑏= “denominator” Unlike ℤ, the set ℚ is closed under division \(so long as 𝑏 ≠ 0\).

ℚ still has an ordering… for any 𝑎≠𝑏∈ℚ : 𝑎&lt;𝑏 or 𝑏&lt;𝑎

### Other Types of Numbers

ℝ – **Real** numbers

ℂ – **Complex** numbers

## Symbols of Logic

⇒ means “implies” : for example 𝑎&gt;5 ⇒ 𝑎&gt;3 

In general, the opposite need not be true: 𝑎&gt;3 ⇏ 𝑎&gt;5

If both directions are true, it’s called equivalent: 𝑎=3 ⇔ 2𝑎=6
