**A matrix is a way of describing linear transformations of vectors**. Can also be called a mapping of vectors.

* For scalar factors 𝑟 ∈ ℝ : 𝐹 𝑟 ⃗ 𝑥 = 𝑟 𝐹 ⃗ 𝑥&#x20;
* For sums of arguments: 𝐹 ⃗ 𝑥 + ⃗ 𝑦 = 𝐹 ⃗ 𝑥 + 𝐹 ⃗ 𝑦

Tensors are used in the tensorflow library, which has multiple uses including: physics, statistics, computer graphics, and neural networks.
