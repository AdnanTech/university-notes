# Programming Concepts

## Learning Outcomes

* Develop an algorithm from a given problem specification.
* Prove that a given algorithm is correct for a given problem specification.
* Analyse a given algorithm and establish its time complexity class.
* Spot mistakes and suggest possible improvements for a given algorithm.

## Outline

This module provides an introduction to algorithmic problem solving. It will answer the following questions: What is a problem specification, an algorithm, a computation? What are their properties? How does one develop an algorithm? How can one rigorously argue that an algorithm computes correct solutions to a given problem? How can one measure the efficiency of an algorithm and the complexity of a problem? For the sake of writing algorithms, a simple algorithmic language \(pseudo code\) is in use. The focus is on algorithmic thinking, not coding.

Searching, sorting and other simple \(and intuitive\) algorithms are specified and developed. Principles like divide-and-conquer and recursive programming will be applied and explained.

Two important properties of algorithms are Correctness and Complexity. Algorithms should only compute correct solutions of a problem. To establish correctness, some relevant \(propositional and predicate\) logic is introduced in an informal style \(focusing on logical reasoning principles rather than logical calculi\). Finally, the concept of time complexity of an algorithm is presented and asymptotic complexity classes are discussed.

The exercise classes and coursework are based on a series of examples. The algorithms developed in this module should be implemented in Java concurrently or at a later stage in the further programming module.
