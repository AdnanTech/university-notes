# PDP/Target Setting \(SMART\) and Reflection

### PDP

The Personal Development Plan \(PDP\) files are given on the end of of the Canvas Week Module, I have uploaded mine [**here**](https://github.com/AdnanTech/UniversityOfSussex/tree/master/CommunicationLearningSkills/PDP)\*\*\*\*

* Dont touch section B until week 10

### SMART

* **Specific**
  * \(simple, sensible, significant\)
* **Measurable**
  * \(meaningful, motivating\)
* **Achievable**
  * \(agreed, attainable\)
* **Relevant**
  * \(reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based\)
* **Time-bound**

  * \(time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive\)

* **Specific**: College goals need to be specific to what you want to accomplish, like graduating the University Of Sussex
* **Measurable**: You should be able to track your long-term goals using small stepping stones, like getting all A's this semester.
* **Achievable**: Make goals that are reasonably within reach. For example, if you've been struggling to pass your courses, don't set a goal of graduating with a First. This might be unrealistic.
* **Relevant**: Set goals that are relevant to your college education and future career. For instance, you wouldn't want to strive toward getting an engineering apprenticeship if you plan to go into medicine.
* **Time-Bound**: You need to set a specific end date to look forward to, like getting your Bachelors's degree in four years.
