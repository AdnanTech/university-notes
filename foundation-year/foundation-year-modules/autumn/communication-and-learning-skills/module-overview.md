# Module Overview

## NOTES FROM 1/10

 there is a key information on canvas, for example a section where you can find recordings, the outline in the module information section, a reading list

reading list: the study skills handbook by stella cottrell and skills hub on sussex website

need to download microsoft teams, will replace zoom went over the presentation

this whole topic is about personal development and being a uni student, will have group work

Went through Skills Hub, might be good to make a section for study skills under the meta for this space

Presentation is in week 7, this is important

week 9 is when the presentation work is due

Went over the brief of module content and stuff

#### Learning Diary

Learning diary is important, kind of like a blog entry, but needs to have a section with key topics covered, and my **honest thoughts** 

they can be as simple as week 1: struggling with maths, then at the end of 6 entries a box for a small summary, wiht key sections in bold, week 1 and 2 are combined into 1 entry, 500 words of content a week

maybe split each paragraph into the module name and what i learnt or struggled with. then put a summative comment at the end, also adding key words and phrases in bold and italics.

MATLAB can be integrated with C

Maybe make a gitbook space for the learning diary, or maybe a topic session in communication and learning skills

TO SUBMIT: discussions on the module on canvas, and then write a reply showing where the entry is \(gitbook\), maybe also export as a pdf?

Went over academic advisors

name, home town, fave food, hobby, reason for choosing the course, and a suprising/interesting facts - peer introduction for next week
