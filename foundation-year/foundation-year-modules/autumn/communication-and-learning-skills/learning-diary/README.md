# Learning Diary

* Learning diary is important, its similar to a blog entry, but needs to have a section with key topics covered, and my **honest thoughts**
* **TO SUBMIT:** discussions section on the CLS module on canvas, and then write a reply showing where the entry is: gitbook, or export as a pdf
* 500 words of content a week is the guideline
* Add key words and phrases in bold and italics.
