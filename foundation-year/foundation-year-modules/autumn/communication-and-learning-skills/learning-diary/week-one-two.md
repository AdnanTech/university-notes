# Week one/two

**Foundation Programming:** The past 2 weeks, we covered the fundamental basics of C, as well as discussing the large array of different types of programming. I decided to do further research and learnt that programming languages are leaves to the tree of the programming paradigm. This consolidated my knowledge further, as it creates a network of programming theory.

**CLS:** In the last two weeks, we briefly touched on the module overview, as well as the higher education soft skills, which can be summarized as metacognitive skills, social skills, time management, organisation and self-reflection. Although the course has felt slow, it is understandable as the first weeks are introductory type lessons. I have taken initiative and created a trello board to keep up with my university work. I also have a knowlesge base where I intend to add my personal research notes on metacognition by the end of the weekend. I also have planned to make a blog using no frameworks, purely php and javascript, as a helpful pre-cursor to our Computing Modules, PHP and JS

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** Mathematics has been trivial, as it is mainly GCSE level of math, which i have prior experience in. Because it is has been fairly straightforward, I have gone ahead and attempted and marked topic 1 and 2s worksheets, which i intend

**Computing Project:** I found x hard and y easy

**Summative Evaluation:** Overall i think x
