Learning diary is important, kind of like a blog entry, but needs to have a section with key topics covered, and my **honest thoughts**

TO SUBMIT: discussions on the module on canvas, and then write a reply showing where the entry is \(gitbook\), maybe also export as a pdf?

they can be as simple as week 1: struggling with maths, then at the end of 6 entries a box for a small summary, wiht key sections in bold, week 1 and 2 are combined into 1 entry, 500 words of content a week

maybe split each paragraph into the module name and what i learnt or struggled with. then put a summative comment at the end, also adding key words and phrases in bold and italics.

Maybe make a gitbook space for the learning diary, or maybe a topic session in communication and learning skills

name, home town, fave food, hobby, reason for choosing the course, and a suprising/interesting facts - peer introduction for next week
