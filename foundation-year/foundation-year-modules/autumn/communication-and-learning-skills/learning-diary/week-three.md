# Week three

**Foundation Programming:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that all programming topics are important as they correlate directly to module assesments, which inclues an exam and 2 mini-projects. This week we covered operators and iteration.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that the learning diary, portfolio and social skills must be developed well, the study skills are merely supplementary to help complete the tasks, however a lot of the study skills topics will be redundant due to the fact I have a solid fundamental of routines, habits, time management and cognitive science. This week we did x

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that all topics will need to be understood on a fundemantal level as well as great logic skills in order to complete the problem sets, as well as the exam. The past week we have covered trigonometry.

**Computing Project:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know amd what is beyond the module specifacation. As a result I have decided to mainly focus on the project, along with the technical documentation. Meanwhile, I intend to create only brief notes on the web development side of the module, as well as creating my blog to get hands on experience with the web technologies. The past week we have covered HTML.
