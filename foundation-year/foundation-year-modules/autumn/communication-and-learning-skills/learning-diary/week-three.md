# Week three

**Foundation Programming:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that all programming topics are important as they correlate directly to module assesments, which inclues an **exam** and **2 projects**. This week we covered operators again, program design and iteration. My take from the program design topic is that it can be tedious and unproductive to design the program with Richard's rules. However, I also understand it is part of the topic and the _rules must be abided_ to in order to **pass** the **assessed projects**. The highlight of foundation programming classes this week was the difference between ++num and ++num during assignment, this got me thinking about the **order of precedence** and how machines, more importantly how **machines operate during** the use the **C programming language**, and inteperet the code on a **semantic** level, just like **humans** interpret **semantic** differently based on the language. _For example, Arabic is read from right to left, whereas this is not the case in British English, as it is read from left to right. It is especially interesting to use Arabs in this case since they were key motivators towards the development of mathematics at a fundamental level, whereas the English dictated the development of machines on a fundamental level._

**Communication and Learning Skills:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that the **learning diary**, **portfolio** and **social skills** must be developed well. Whilst the portfolio has not been fully revealed to us, at the moment I can conclude that the portfolio entails the PDP. Also, the study skills are merely supplementary to help complete the tasks. In addition, a lot of the study skills topics we cover in class will be redundant due to the fact I have a solid fundamental of routines, habits, time management and cognitive science due to my personal [knowledge base](https://app.gitbook.com/@adnanquisar/s/wiki/categories-of-life). **This week we did x**

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that all topics will need to be understood on a fundemantal level as well as great logic skills in order to complete the problem sets, as well as the exam. I also contemplated whether the maths worksheets are worth my time if I already have a fundamental understanding from prior math experience, I came to the conclusion the worksheets are not worth my time, and i should dedicate only a little time to maths revision, and spend the extra hours on other modules that need work. **The past week we have covered trigonometry.**

**Computing Project:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know amd what is beyond the module specifacation. As a result I have decided to mainly focus on the project, along with the technical documentation. Meanwhile, I intend to create only brief notes on the web development side of the module, as well as creating my blog to get hands on experience with the web technologies. **The past week we have covered HTML.**

**Summative Evaluation:** _Work hard, work smart, work consistently_. This is a philosophy my basketball coach taught me when I was younger. I have started to **plan** out the next **day in advance,** during the **evening prior** to the day. As well as this, I've taken an approach of being more **specific with my time management**, this means that instead of just _blocking out a session_ on my google calendar for an activity such as "reading", I've refactored the process to hone in on a specific module task, for example "CLS PDP" or "MFC1 Trigonometry Worksheets". This allows me to be more specific in my tasks, thus my goals become clearer.

As well as **refining** my **workflow** to only _abstract_ the **relevant** information. I have taken the 4 modules for Autumn and have split them two _categories_, **Algortihmic and Logic based**, and **Iterative documentation** based_. Mathematics for Computing 1_ and _Foundation Programming_ both **subside** in the **algorithmic and logic** **based** category as they require learning core principles, and applying the principles through consistent practice, making use of logical thinking skills. The other category, **iterative documentation based** modules consist of _Communication and Learning Skills_ as well as the _Computing Project_, with these topics I will take a more **iterative approach**, which takes the form of **documentation**, as well as brief notes.
