# Week three

**Foundation Programming:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that all programming topics are important as they correlate directly to module assesments, which inclues an exam and 2 mini-projects. This week we covered operators, program design and iteration. My take from the program design topic is that it can be tedious and unproductive to design the program with Richard's rules. However, I also understand it is part of the topic and the rules must be abided to in order to pass the assessed projects. The highlight of the foundation programming was the difference between ++num and ++num during assignment, this got me thinking about the order of precedence and how machines, more importantly how machines use the C programming language, and inteperet the code on a semantic level, just like humans interpret semantic differently based on the language. For example, Arabic is read from right to left, whereas this is not the case in British English.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that the learning diary, portfolio and social skills must be developed well, the study skills are merely supplementary to help complete the tasks, however a lot of the study skills topics will be redundant due to the fact I have a solid fundamental of routines, habits, time management and cognitive science. This week we did x

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know and what is beyond the module specifacation, thus extra work. From looking at the module specification, I can conclude that all topics will need to be understood on a fundemantal level as well as great logic skills in order to complete the problem sets, as well as the exam. The past week we have covered trigonometry.

**Computing Project:** Now that we have past the introductory weeks, it was a good idea to have a look at the module assesment information and hone in on what I need to know amd what is beyond the module specifacation. As a result I have decided to mainly focus on the project, along with the technical documentation. Meanwhile, I intend to create only brief notes on the web development side of the module, as well as creating my blog to get hands on experience with the web technologies. The past week we have covered HTML.

**Summative Evaluation:** _Work hard, work smart, work consistently_. This is a philosophy my basketball coach taught me when I was younger. I have started to plan out the next day in advance, during the evening prior to the day. As well as this, I've taken an approach of being more specific with my time management, this means instead of blocking out a session on my google calendar for just "reading", I've refactored the process to hone in on a specific module task, for example "CLS PDP" or "MFC1 Trigonometry Worksheets.

As well as refining my workflow to only abstract the relevant information. The 4 modules for Autumn I have split into 2 categories, Algortihmic and Logic based, and Iterative documentation based. Mathematics for Computing 1 and Foundation Programming both subside in the algorithmic and logic based require learning core principles, they are more practice based, and make use of logical and algorithmic thinking. The other category consists of Communication and Learning Skills as well as the Computing Project, with these topics I will take a more iterative approach, which takes the form of documentation, as well as brief notes.
