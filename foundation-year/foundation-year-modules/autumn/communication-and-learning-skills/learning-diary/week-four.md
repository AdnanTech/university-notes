# Week four

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered more loops and selection. Whilst I have covered these topics before with my time programming, C is a lot more close to metal \(hardware\), and therefore doesn't have high level programming language features such as garbage collection, instead you can manually adjust the heap and malloc, and more. One of the more interesting features I learnt was the function of buffers, and how it affects Input from the user during program runtime.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week I found very interesting, as I have always felt like I do not have any time, when in reality, I just am not managing my time well. This personal philosophy led me on a path of self improvement in which I am always trying to get the most done in 24 hours, at maximum effeciency and without burning out in the process. Thus new concepts of time management were introduced to me, which i have thought about integrating into my workflow, inside and outside of work. We also started group work

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** Logarithms, as well as completing maths assignment 1 and submitting

**Computing Project:** Covered CSS. Applied theories in class around css to my freelance project I intend to complete by the end of next month.

**Summative Evaluation:** Overall i think
