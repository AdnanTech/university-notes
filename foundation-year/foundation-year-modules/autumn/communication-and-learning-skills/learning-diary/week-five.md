# Week five

**Foundation Programming:** This week we covered arrays and strings. The most intriguing thing we covered was the way declaring string literals \(array of characters\) work, as there is always a trailing \0 \(NULL\) byte. This is only the case, when the NULL terminator is added, when characters are declared like a string \("hello world"\), rather than char letters\[4\] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', '0' }. This touched base on the theory and concept of pointers. Which is interesting because I've only ever worked with high level languages, where the stack is a lot further from metal \(hardware\), and a lot of the under the hood side of things is covered up. So whilst the content was at times slow, some of the concepts advocated theory of computers I don't know a lot about, which made the content more digestable.

**Communication and Learning Skills:** This week we covered researching methods and did more group work.

**Mathematics For Computing 1:** Mathematics this week was ok. We covered lines and curves, more specifically, quadratics and polar co-ordinates. Polar co-ordinates I found especially interesting, as computer vision, to be more precise, bionic eyes is a topic that I'd like to delve quite deep into. And the concept of polar co-ordinates binds to bionic eyes becuase Kingsley stated in one of the lectures, that polar co-ordinates is the underlying theme of computer vision, and the concept can also be applied to human eyes.

**Computing Project:** The focus this week was CSS, as well as a lecture touching on artificial intelligence. The CSS was fairly straight forward. As with previous topics, even though I know how to write CSS fluently, some lesser known features such as the types of selectors and the range of selectors. This prompted me to think about how to structure my CSS code syntatically to effectively use selectors 

**Summative Evaluation:** Overall I think the week
