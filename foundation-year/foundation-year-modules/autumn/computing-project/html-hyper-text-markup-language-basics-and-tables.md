# HTML  Basics and Tables

**HTML basics**

Hyper Text Markup Language \(HTML\) is a markup language that defines the structure of your content

* HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose or wrap diffrent parts of the cotnent to make it appear or act a certain way
  * The opening tag defines the way an element is diplayed \(image, url, italics\)
* General form of a HTML element `<opening tag> Content </closing tag>`
* A **html tag i**s a set of characters that sets the way content is displayed on a web page
* An **element** comprises of the opening tag, closing tag, and the content within the tags
* **Attributes** contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. 
  * Here, `class` is the attribute _name_ and `editor-note` is the attribute _value_. The `class` attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it \(and any other elements with the same `class` value\) with style information and other things.
  * A_**n id is x y z, its different to a class because it can only be applied to one element**_
    * An attribute should always have the following:
      * A space between it and the element name \(or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes\).
      * The attribute name followed by an equal sign
      * The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
        * example: `<p class="example-class">Lorem Ipsum</p>`
        *          `<p id="example-class">Lorem Ipsum</p>`
* Why do we separate HTML and CSS?
* What are forms?
* What is a div?
* What are selectors?
* What are properties?
* What are values?
* What is the “query string” in a URL and what does it do?
* What is the difference between “pixels” and “ems”?
* How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? i.e. how does an element get its “default” styles?
* What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?
* What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?
* What is the “default stylesheet” or “user agent stylesheet”?
* Why use a CSS reset file?
