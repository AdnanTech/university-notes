# Module Overview

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe some key application areas of computing, such are artificial intelligence, digital media and web development
* Conduct a project of individual research on a key area of computing
* Identify appropriate software within a computing application area
* Present work in a clear and well-structured way orally and in writing

## Outline

This module provides an introduction to a number of key areas of computing \(e.g. Artificial Intelligence, Digital Media, Web Development, eBusiness\) and equips students to make informed choices regarding degree courses on offer within Informatics. Students elect to study one area in greater depth and carry out an individual computing project. The project may involve a programming element, but may in some cases be purely research based \(e.g. a case study on the use of a particular aspect of IT in a business setting\). The module allows the application of both computing skills gained on other foundation modules and professional/study skills \(e.g. research, report writing presentation\) as part of a more extended research project.
