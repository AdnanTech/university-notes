# Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web

## Rough notes from 1/10

computing project shawcross:

looked at a presentation about the computing project

we cover web dev with ramiz, and AI with kinglsey

is a readling list, but the list is more general you have to pass all modules

1500 words intro report 4000 words full report

its worth 30 credits, 40% is minimum pass rate

also a schedule on canvas

in semester 2, there is no timed blocks, its all self dev work instead

what is the world wide web? answer and email ramiz

---evening session: Sussex Selfies

sussex direct you can check your attendance CLS learning diary attendance is in module progress and feedback - and in the clumn on the furthest right it says attendance CLS seems to be how they track your progress

went over some project ideas: games AI projects general dev/web apps investigative type projects

go hard early on the project and make sure you document as you go
