# Introduction to CSS \(Cascading Style Sheets\)

CSS

*  A **CSS selector** is the part of a CSS rule that describes what elements in a document the rule will match. The matching elements will have the rule's specified style applied to them, examples would be:
  * Type selectors `elementname`
  * Class selectors `.classname`
  * ID selectors `#idname`
  * Universal selectors `* ns|* *|*`
  * Attribute selectors `[attr=value]`
  * State selectors `a:active, a:visited`
* CSS properties are properties you can apply to an element, examples include
  * font-size
  * background-color
  * display
  * padding
  * margin
  * z-index
  * width
* CSS values are values we can apply to css properties, which include
  * Integers
  * real numbers
  * Lengths
  * Percentages
  * URLs \(unfirom resource locators\) and URIs \(uniform resource identifiers\)
  * Counters
  * Colors
* A **query string** is a part of a uniform resource locator \(URL\) that assigns values to specified parameters \(links a href to a link if applied\)
* **Pixel** is a static measurement, 
* while percent and **EM** are relative measurements. The size of an **EM or** percent depends on its parent

| px | em | percent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 23px |  1.4375**em** | 143.75% |
| 24px | 1.5000em | 150.00% |
| 25px | 1.5625em | 156.25% |
