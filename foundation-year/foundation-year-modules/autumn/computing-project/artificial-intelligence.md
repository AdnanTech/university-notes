# Artificial Intelligence

## Lecture Notes

### What is AI?

To define ai, we start with defining intelligence. Turing defined intelligence as the ability to achieve human-level performance in al cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator.

### Some applications of AI

* Expert systems
  * Knowledge based; domain specific
  * Diagnostics
* Research
  * Engineering
  * Biology
  * Defence
  * Entertainment
* Commerce
  * Data Mining
  * City
  * Prospecting
  * Management
  * Security

### Inspirations from Nature to solve AI

* Introspection - Rational thought
* Self observation â€“ our motor reactions
* Biological
  * How a brain works
  * Vision, importance of motion, perspective.
  * Hearing
  * Evolution

### Rational Problem Solving in AI

Defining problems into a set of **rules** so it can be solved

### Searching Methods in AI

* Exhaustive search
* Depth-first, Breadth-first search
* Heuristic search
* Many applications including:
  * Game play
  * Route planning systems

### Graph Theory

In **computer science**, **graph theory** is the study of graphs, a mathematical structure used to model pair wise relations between objects from a certain collection. A **graph** in this context refers to a collection of vertices or nodes and a collection of edges that connect pairs of vertices

## How can AI's Learn?

We can take notes from human interactions:

* Motor reactions \(movement\)
  * Basic functions
  * Automatic response to stimuli
  * Hierarchy of signals
  * Subsumption architecture \(Brooke\)
* Biological reactions \(brain\) - Neural networks are built on the theory of the brain
  * Regions
  * Anatomy
  * Neurons
    * Axons
    * Dendrites
  * Connections
  * Thresholds
  * Synapses
* BRAIN CELL DIAGRAM GOES HERE
* Vision - built on mental models created by the brain
  * Motion
  * Perspective
  * Pattern recognition
* Hearing
  * Relative signals
  * Crickets
  * Sonar - bats
* Evolution
  * Genes
  * Inheritance
    * Sexual
    * Asexual
  * Mutation
  * Selection 
    * Stress
  * Genetic algorithms
* Adaptation \(learning\)
  * Using artificial brain-like network
  * Connections between neurons translate percepts into outputs/actions
  * Measurement of errors, using test data, leads to automatic modification of network \(learning from experience\) until lessons are learnt
  * Good for generalisation
  * Machine learning

### Hard vs Soft AI

soft is rule based

hard is creating rules

### Turing and the Brain

Turing stated specifically, that humans are machines, as the brain sends signals as computers also do.
