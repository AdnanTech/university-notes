## Pre Reading

## Matrices

 A **matrix** is an array of numbers represented in columns and rows, an example is below.

![A 2x2 matrix](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2817%29.png)

A is said to be a2×2 matrix because it has two rows and two columns. These are the **dimensions** of A

In general a matrix is m×n matrix if it has m rows and n columns. This is an important convention to remember.
