# More Trigonometry, Logs and Exponents

## Sin and Cosine Rule

Sine and Cosine rules are used when we have triangles that to _not_ have a right angle to them.

### Sin Rule

We use sin rule when you are given:

* 2 sides and an angle opposite to one of the two sides
* 1 side and 2 angles

### Cosine Rule

We use the cosine rule when you are given:

* 2 sides and an angle
* 3 sides

## Logarithms and Exponents

### Logarithms and Exponents Fundamentals

* **Exponent**: The power to which a number, symbol, or expression is to be raised. For example, the 3 in x^3. 
* **Logarithm**: The **logarithm** of a number is the **exponent** by which another fixed value, the base, has to be raised to produce that number.
* The inverse of the logarithmic operation is exponentiation, and vice versa
* The logarithm is commonly used in many fields: that with base 2 in computer science, that with base e in pure mathematics and financial mathematics, and that with base 10 in natural science and engineering.
