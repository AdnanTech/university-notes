### Polar Co-Ordinates

Polar co-ordinates are diffrent function to a graph, for example, cartesian follows \(point a, point b\), where you go across a and up b to find a point on the line, that is the function. Whereas polar co-ordinates, map to \(r, theta\) for a point

* Where r is a real number \(when squared at least\), that is the radial distance from the distance
* Theta is the anti-clockwise angle from the x axis
* the polar origin is also considered \(0, 0\), as in cartesian equations
* Radial axis is?
* A polar equation can directly correlate to a cartesian equation

It allows us to split a line into triangles, and hence integration, as it essentially is just a bunch of triangles
