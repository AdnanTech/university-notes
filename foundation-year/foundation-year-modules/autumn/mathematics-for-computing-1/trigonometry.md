# Trigonometry and SOHCAHTOA

## Trigonmetry

* **Galileo Galilei** was the inventor of Trigonometry as we know it today, he was bored looking at a pendulum ina catherdral one morning and then here we are
* All functions are an axiom of y = f\(x\), trig functions included
  * Sin's real function can be found [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html)
* [Circular phasor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_zReGTxdlQ) instructs that \(sin\) circles = \(sin\) waves
  * Also proves the radians units, as 2 pi is the circumference
  * This brings about the equation w = 2 pi f
    * where w is the angular frequency \(radians\)
    * f is the frequency
* Trig, especially sin, just appears in nature everywhere, thus super useful 
* A circle is 360 degrees because we chose it to be so it is easy to divide
  * In game dev, they choose 256 degrees to store circles into one byte
* The  domain for sin can be displayed as
  * R: -1 &lt;= r &lt;= 1

$$
1^* =  \tfrac{2pi}{f}
$$

* When involving sin with time, we get 

$$
f(t) = sin(wt) = sin(2pi*f)
$$

* Tan has asymptotes cause it is equal to sin/cos, and when cos = 0, than will be equal to infinity, negative infinity, or zero, it is unsolvable, thus we write a zero.
  * so its co domain would be
    * R: \(-ve\)infinity &lt;= r &lt;= \(+ve\)infinity 
* There are also reciprocal functions

$$
cot =  \tfrac{1}{tan} \space \space \space | \space \space \space cosec =  \tfrac{1}{sin} \space \space \space | \space \space \space sec =  \tfrac{1}{tan}= \tfrac{cos}{sin}
$$

* There are also inverse functions

$$
sin^{-1} \space \space \space | \space \space \space cos^{-1} \space \space \space | \space \space \space tan^{-1}
$$

## SOHCAHTOA

* SOHCAHTOA exists cause of the trig circles, where if you draw a right angled triangle that constitutes 2 radius'. you get an unknown angle in the center between the radius' that is equal to tan\(o/a\)
  * Thus triangles map to circles in trig

## Misc

* Computers can't actually generate random numbers, this problem is uncomputable, as us humans wrote the program, thus not random
  * maybe it takes the date time and squares it
  * maybe it looks at the current free memory locations
* Point is, there is an inverse function, it's just made so the users cannot see, thus appearing random
