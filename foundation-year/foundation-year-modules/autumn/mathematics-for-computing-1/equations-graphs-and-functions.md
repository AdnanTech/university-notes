# Equations, Graphs, Fractions and BEDMAS

### Equations

* Equations are called equations due to idea of equality \(=\) of variables
* They all are a rearrangement of the first principle axiom, 1=1
* Axioms are statements that we assume to be true, maths is built on them
* 0=0 is not an equation, as it doesnt follow the rule of when you apply different expressions to each side of the equation, you still get 0=0, breaking the first axiom rule
* Light note on Turing/Turing machines
* Computing is large scale mathematics, all numerical, due to Turing
* There is a sense of dualism of equations, where left = right is always true

### Graphs

* All equations can be represented as graphs and vice versa
* There are visual and numeric representations of data
* Independant variable goes on the x axis, this is what you change
* Dependant variable goes in the y axis, this is what you measure
* linear equations are inveratable problems, you can find the equation if given points, and vice versa
* The way to solve linear equations is like so:

$$
y = (dy/dx)x + c
$$

* General form of a polynomial \(qudratic, cubic, etc\) can be respresented like so:

$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c || y = ax^3+bx^2+cx+d
$$

### Fractions

* Fraction is just a division of: numerator / denominator
* Computers have errors in representing infinitely long decimales
* pi and e cant be represented fully in digits, hence accuracy of symbols and fractions
* There are 3 types of fractions
  * Proper \(2/9\)
  * Improper \(9/2\)
  * Mixed \(2 1/2\)
* When adding/subtracting, all denominators must be the same
  * Lowest common multiple is the similar denominator
  * or you can times all denominators together to get **atleast a** common denominator
    * the second method is used in cryptography, with public/private keys combined with prime numbers
* To multiply fractions, you just multiply the numerators together, as well as the denominators
* To divide fractions, you invert the divisor and multiply the equation
  * so \(1/2\) / \(1/3\) can be written as \(1/2\) \* \(3/1\) = 3/2

### BEDMAS

BEDMAS is the order of precedence in which calculations are executed:

* Brackets
* Exponent
* Division
* Multiplication
* Addition
* Subtraction
