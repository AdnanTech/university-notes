# Factorisation and Functions

### Factorisation

* Factorisation is the process of breaking down a mathematical expression into its constituent parts
  * if you multiply the parts, you get the original expressio
* Prime numbers' factors are special becayse they are only 1 and itself, assuming only integer values
* When factorising, we use the smallest prime number factors \(1,2 \(only even prime number!\),3,5,7,11\)
* The point of factorisation is to simplify expressions into smaller, more digestable expressins to solve
  * for example:

$$
\tfrac{72}{108} = \tfrac{2*2*2*3*3}{2*2*3*3*3} =\tfrac{2}{3}
$$

* When factors are multiplied together, they must equal 0

$$
(2x^2+x-1) =(2x-1)(x+1) \\x = \tfrac{1}{2}=(2x-1) =0\\x = -1 =(x+1) = 0
$$

### Functions

* Functions are the idea of how computers work
  * Input\(s\)
  * Internal working \(process\)
  * Output
