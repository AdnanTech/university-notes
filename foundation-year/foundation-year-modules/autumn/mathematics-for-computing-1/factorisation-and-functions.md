# Factorisation and Functions

### Equations

* Equations are called equations due to idea of equality \(=\) of variables
* They all are a rearrangement of the first principle axiom, 1=1
* Axioms are statements that we assume to be true, maths is built on them
* 0=0 is not an equation, as it doesnt follow the rule of when you apply different expressions to each side of the equation, you still get 0=0, breaking the first axiom rule
* Light note on Turing/Turing machines
* Computing is large scale mathematics, all numerical, due to Turing
* There is a sense of dualism of equations, where left = right is always true

### Graphs

* All equations can be represented as graphs and vice versa
* There are visual and numeric representations of data
* Independant variable goes on the x axis, this is what you change
* Dependant variable goes in the y axis, this is what you measure
