# Factorisation and Functions

### Factorisation

* Factorisation is the process of breaking down a mathematical expression into its constituent parts
  * if you multiply the parts, you get the original expressio
* Prime numbers' factors are special becayse they are only 1 and itself, assuming only integer values
* When factorising, we use the smallest prime number factors \(1,2 \(only even prime number!\),3,5,7,11\)
* The point of factorisation is to simplify expressions into smaller, more digestable expressins to solve
  * for example:

$$
\tfrac{72}{108} = \tfrac{2*2*2*3*3}{2*2*3*3*3} =\tfrac{2}{3}
$$

* When factors are multiplied together, they must equal 0

$$
(2x^2+x-1) =(2x-1)(x+1) \\x = \tfrac{1}{2}=(2x-1) =0\\x = -1 =(x+1) = 0
$$

### Functions

* Functions are the idea of how computers work
  * Input \(**can be many**\)
  * Internal working \(process, algorithms\)
  * Output \(**only one**\)
* Output = name\(input\):
  * where name \(f\) can be synonymous with internal working
* x is the input \(independant variable\)
* y is the output \(dependant variable\)

$$
x \space \epsilon \space R \space \space \space \space \space \space y = f(x)
$$

* Mathematical functions are very similar to computational functions, because computational functions were built from mathematicians
* Definitons
  * **N**: the set of all natural numbers \(integers excluding 0 and &lt;0\)
  * **Z**: the set of all natural numbers \(all of N, plus 0 and &lt;0\)
  * **R**: ****A value along a continuous line \(floating point numbers\)
  * **Domain**: the set of numbers that the _independant_ variable can take
  * **Co-domain/Range**: the set of numbers that the _dependent_ variable can take

$$
f(x) = x^2 \space \space \space \space \space -> \space \space \space \space R \overset{f}{=>}R
$$

* A fundamental principle of functions is that every mapping in the domain, maps to one co-domain
* take f\(x\) = x^2

| Domain \(x\) | Co-Domain mapping \(y\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| -2 | 4 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 |
| -3 | 9 |

* As we can see, one domain \(input\) has an unambigous one co-domain mapping \(output\)
* There are also **Inverse functions**

$$
if \thickspace f(x)=2x \thickspace  then \thickspace f(x)^{-1} = \tfrac{x}{2}
$$

* To solve these, we just make the independant variable the subject of the equation
* Covered composition of functions: g\(f\(x\)\), for example

$$
f(x) = x^2 \space \space \space \space g(x)=x+2 \\ g(f(x)): \space \space \space x^2+2
$$
