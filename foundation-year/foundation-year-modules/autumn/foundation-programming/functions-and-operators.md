# Functions and Operators

### Functions

* In **programming** a function \(method in OOP, procedure/subroutine if nothing is returned\) a block of code, which **given a set of any amount of parameters**, performs a task and can **return exactly one value**. Every C program has at least one function, which is main\(\), the main\(\) function is run on program execution, main\(\) in turn calls \(runs\) standard library functions and also user defined functions.
* In **maths** a function is an equation for which any given x into the equation, it will return exactly one y
* A **function prototype** \(declaration\) tells the compiler about a _function's name, return type, and parameters_. A function definition provides the actual body of the function
* **Refer to** [**Code Base** ](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/code/)**for C Function Examples**

### Operators

An **operator** is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result, the main types are arithmetic, assignment and relational

**Operators follow the order of precedence \(BEDMAS\)**

### There are 3 main types of operators

#### Arithmetic Operators

* An operator is like a function, where things get worked out and a value is returned. For example, with x + y the addition operator causes the value of x plus y to be returned. For an operator to work, it requires one or more OPERAND. So in the previous example, x and y are both operands. They would be called parameters for a function. Without one or the other, the addition operator won't work.

| Arithmetic operator | Operation |
| :--- | :--- |
| + | Addition |
| - | Subtraction |
| \* | Multiplacation |
| / | Division |
| % | Modulus \(remainder of division\) |
| ++ | Increment |
| -- \(- -\) | Decrement |

#### Arithmetic assignment Operators

| Arithmetic Assignment Operator | Less efficient equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| x += y; | x = x + y; |
| x -= y; | x = x - y; |
| x \*= y; | x = x \* y; |
| x /= y; | x = x / y; |
| x %= y; | x = x % y; |

#### Relational Operators

| Relational Operator | Operation |
| :--- | :--- |
| &lt; | Less than |
| &gt; | Greater than |
| &lt;= | Less than or equal to |
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |
