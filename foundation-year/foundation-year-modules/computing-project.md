# Computing Project

### Overview

I intend to create a fully fledged cloud-based SaaS Point Of Sale \(POS\) program, that i can scale up to be a B2B company. 

Problem: My father owns a grocery store and does all the work manually:

* Counts stock on the shelves
* Counts stock in the storeroom
* cash till item prices are entered manually
* check stock that needs to be refilled from the shelves and the storeroom from wholesalers
