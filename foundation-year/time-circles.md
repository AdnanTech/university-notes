# Time Circles

These are my time circles, where I will experiment recording my events, in the form of time, during a 24 hour period, in order to get better at time management.This test begins the week beginning 26/10/2020 and will end  1/11/2020

## 27/10/2020

### Evaluation

* Spent 8-9:30 finishing my youtube-downloader project - not a lot of uni reading to do
* 9:45 left for town
* 12-12:20 commute home
* 12:20 - 2 ate food, mental break
* 2-6 doing half of the dedicated 16 hours of work today, as i usually do 2 hours mon to thur and 8 hours friday. Doing 4 hours today means that thursday is free for other activities.
* 6-6:30  mental break

### Evalutation

* Morning session from 8-9 can get very unfocused, I tend to drift, checking messages and emails. This could be as I am not writing down defined objectives, merely "University pre reading" instead.
* Around 9:30 I got into the flow of things, _turning off WhatsApp notifications_ and making great progress on my [group work](group-work.md)
* After my lecture finished at 1pm, I pranced around and eased my mind and body for 45 mins, considering commuting for my 3pm class takes 15 minutes, this means I was only able to do an hour of work, leaving another hour to be made up for in the afternoon.
* I can get **distracted** with YouTube **comments** and **recommendations** easily
* I also get **distracted** by my **phone**
* After my class finished at 4pm, commute home took 20 minutes, eating and hanging up clothes etc took 20, and marking my little brothers homework also took 20 minutes
* Currently 5pm, this leaves me with 3 hours of free time left, as one hour is the work that I still need to do.
* Did an hour of work from 5-6, then a work call that lasted 30 mins. So i have from 6:30 onwards as free time.
* 6:30 to 7:15pm I created tomorrow's time circle and then took a _mental break._
* 7:15 to 8:15pm dinner
* 8:15 to 10:15 I worked on the yt-downloader project
* Overall I think I was about 65% accurate in my planning today, didn't account for getting distractd, as well as commuting time
