## What are SMART goals?

### Specific

Your goal should be clear and specific, otherwise you won't be able to focus your efforts or feel truly motivated to achieve it. When drafting your goal, try to answer the five "W" questions:

* **What do I want to accomplish?**
* **Why is this goal important?**
* **Who is involved?**
* **Where is it located?**
* **Which resources or limits are involved?**

### Measurable

It's important to have measurable goals, so that you can track your progress and stay motivated. Assessing progress helps you to stay focused, meet your deadlines, and feel the excitement of getting closer to achieving your goal.

A measurable goal should address questions such as:

* **How much?**
* **How many?**
* **How will I know when it is accomplished?**

### Achievable

Your goal also needs to be realistic and attainable to be successful. In other words, it should stretch your abilities but still remain possible. When you set an achievable goal, you may be able to identify previously overlooked opportunities or resources that can bring you closer to it.

An achievable goal will usually answer questions such as:

* **How can I accomplish this goal?**
* **How realistic is the goal, based on other constraints, such as financial factors?**

### Relevant

This step is about ensuring that your goal matters to you, and that it also aligns with other relevant goals. We all need support and assistance in achieving our goals, but it's important to retain control over them. So, make sure that your plans drive everyone forward, but that you're still responsible for achieving your own goal.

A relevant goal can answer "yes" to these questions:

* **Does this seem worthwhile?**
* **Is this the right time?**
* **Does this match our other efforts/needs?**
* **Am I the right person to reach this goal?**
* **Is it applicable in the current socio-economic environment?**

### Time-bound

Every goal needs a target date, so that you have a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. This part of the SMART goal criteria helps to prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals.

A time-bound goal will usually answer these questions:

* **When?**
* **What can I do six months from now?**
* **What can I do six weeks from now?**
* **What can I do today?**

## SMART Example

* **Specific**
  * \(simple, sensible, significant\)
* **Measurable**
  * \(meaningful, motivating\)
* **Achievable**
  * \(agreed, attainable\)
* **Relevant**
  * \(reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based\)
* **Time-bound**

  * \(time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive\)

* **Specific**: University goals need to be specific to what you want to accomplish, like _graduating the University Of Sussex_
* **Measurable**: You should be able to track your long-term goals using small stepping stones, like _getting all A's this semester._
* **Achievable**: Make goals that are reasonably within reach. For example, if you've been struggling to pass your courses, don't set a goal of _graduating with a First_. This might be unrealistic.
* **Relevant**: Set goals that are _relevant to your future career_ and university education. For instance, you wouldn't want to strive toward getting an engineering apprenticeship if you plan to go into medicine.
* **Time-Bound**: You need to set a specific end date to look forward to, like _getting your Bachelors's degree in four years_.

## Why should use SMART goals?

Using the SMART goal framework sets boundaries and defines the steps you’ll need to take, resources necessary to get there and milestones that indicate progress along the way. With SMART goals, you’re more likely to achieve your goal efficiently and effectively.

## What are life's subcomponents?

The subcomponents that are the meta categeories to life, an extension to the big 5 principle taken from psychology. To see all categories, visit [here](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/wiki/categories-of-life).
