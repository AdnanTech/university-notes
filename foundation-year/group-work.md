## Turing Test

### What is the Turing Test?

The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

### Rewiring the question "Can machines think?" 

Turing stated that the question "can machines think?" is too vague, instead he proposed the concept of the "imitation game" instead, which a lot more "unambigous" than the former question.

### Imitation game

The imitation game is a game of three players, having two humans and one computer, an interrogator \(as human\) is isolated from other two players. The interrogator job is to try and figure out _which one_ is **human** and which one is **computer** by asking questions from both of them. To make the things harder computer is trying to make the interrogator guess wrongly. In other words computer would try to indistinguishable from human as much as possible.
