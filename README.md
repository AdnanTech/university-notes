# University Notes

These are my notes whilst studying at the University Of Sussex. Going to try and cut out a lot of the bloat that is on canvas and any information I find redundant in lectures and seminars. I will be including snippets of information I find interesting to link the neurological pathways in my brain better in a result to understand core principles better.
