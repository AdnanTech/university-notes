# Relational Databses

## Database

A collection of organised data■Data has structure■Can be paper-based■More common to talk about electronic databasesi.e. computer-based

## Relational Database

Relational Approach■The problems associated with flat files can be solved by moving some of the data out of the main table and accessing it when required•A relational database is a more complex database that stores data in separate / multiple tables that are interrelated. This allows data to be cross-referenced as and when required.

RDB -benefits■Reduced redundancy■Improved data consistency■Improved data integrity■Better security■Program-data independence

## Flatfile Database

A flat-file database is a simple database that stores all data in a single table■A flat-file database can be stored in a text file, such as a tab-delimited file; a spreadsheet; or in a database filethat contains one or more unrelatedtables.



Flat File Databases■Useful for simple lists:–Address book/contact list–CD collection■But many problems–complex tasks–what problems can you identify?

Redundancy■Large amounts of duplicated data■Makes data entry slower■Uses disk space■Leads to other problems...

Reduced data integrity■More likely to be inaccurate!

Due to:–Data input errors–Inconsistent data entry

Difficult to update–If entries change all instances have to be updatedSecurity–All users have access to the same set of dataProgram-Data Dependence–The user interface \(amongst other things\) is tied to a specific file. To create new views of data you would need to create new data files
