# Relational Databses

## Database

A collection of organised data

* Data has structure
* Can be paper-based
* More common to talk about electronic databases i.e. computer-based

## Relational Database

The problems associated with flat files can be solved by moving some of the data out of the main table and accessing it when required

A relational database is a more complex database that stores data in separate / multiple tables that are interrelated. This allows data to be cross-referenced as and when required.

**Advantages:**

* Reduced redundancy
* Improved data consistency
* Improved data integrity
* Better security
* Program-data independence

## Flatfile Database

A flat-file database is a simple database that stores all data in a single table■A flat-file database can be stored in a text file, such as a tab-delimited file; a spreadsheet; or in a database filethat contains one or more unrelatedtables.

**Advantages:**

* Useful for simple lists:
  * Address book/contact list–CD collection

**Disadvantages:**

* Redundancy
  * Large amounts of duplicated data
  * Makes data entry slower
  * Uses disk space
  * Leads to other problems...
* Reduced data integrity
  * More likely to be inaccurate!
* Due to data input errors
  * Inconsistent data entry
* Difficult to update
  * If entries change all instances have to be updated
* Security
  * All users have access to the same set of data
* Program-Data Dependence
  * The user interface \(amongst other things\) is tied to a specific file. To create new views of data you would need to create new data files
