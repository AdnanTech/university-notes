# Object Oriented

## The Basics

Object Oriented can be broken down into Object Oriented Analysis \(OOA\), Object Oriented Design \(OOD\) and Object Oriented Programming \(OOP\).

### Key Terms

**Object:** An object is an **instance** of a **class** \(derived from classes\) or a **variable \(fields\)** that defines data and behaviour**.** An object can be a combination of variables, functions and data structures.

**Attribute:** An attribute is **property** or **member variable.** Attributes are data elements of objects, so they store data inside a class or instance, about the instance. Is also pretty much equivalent to a **field**.

**Class:** A class is a **blueprint** for defining **objects.**

## Scope

## Classes & Methods

## Constructors & Destructors

## What makes OOP

The key concept for the Object Oriented approach to programming is the **relationship** between classes and objects

### Polymorphism

### Inheritance

Generalisation and specialisation, Parent and child, super class and subclass, and base class and derived class.

### Abstraction

### Encapsulation
