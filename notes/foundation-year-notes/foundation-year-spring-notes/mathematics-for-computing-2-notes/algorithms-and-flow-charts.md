# Algorithms & Flow Charts

## Data Structures

### Tuples

Tuples are **ordered** lists of a specific amount of elements, the key thing to remember here is that they are ordered. So when comparing them, unlike sets, if they are not in the same order, they will not be equal.

We call them n tuples, where n is the amount of "columns" in the tuple.

Curly braces {} are used for sets, round brackets \(\) are used for tuples. Saying so, they can also be empty like sets can. Set notation can also be applied to tuples.

Tuples can be used for:

* Function parameters
* Data fields in a class \(like a struct in the C programming language\)
* A row in a database
* Data in a spreadsheet
* Provides quite a precise way of specifying how some data is supposed to be organised

### Lists and Sequences

Lists are unordered, of one datatype, and have no limit, and start at index 1.

Sequences are ordered lists, of one data type, and have no limit, and start at index 1.

### Arrays

Arrays are sequences defined by an array index. The key difference is that arrays start at index 0. 

Vectors are dynamic arrays. Arrays are not naturally dynamic, they are fixed sizes.

## Algorithms

Sorting is a class of algorithm, it helps us manage and search data.

## Flow charts

Flow charts are graphs that represent programs. Essentially alternatives to pseudo code.

### Example
