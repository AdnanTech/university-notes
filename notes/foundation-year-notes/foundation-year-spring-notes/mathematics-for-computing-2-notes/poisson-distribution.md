# Poisson Distribution

So normal distribution was for lots of outcomes \(x values\) in a given data set. Binomal was for only 2 outcomes. Whilst Poisson, is for counts, so if events happen at a constant rate over time, Poisson distribution gives the probability of X number of events occuring in time T.

## Formulae

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28148%29.png)

* E\(X\) = lambda \* t
* Var\(X\) = lambda \* t

**IMPORTANT NOTE: For a possion random variable, the variance and the mean are the same. Therefore, the mean is actually the number of events in a given time period, lamda equals mu**.

This means that the standard deviation, is the sqaure root of lambda.
