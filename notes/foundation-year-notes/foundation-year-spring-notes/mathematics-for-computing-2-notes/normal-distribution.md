# Normal Distribution

Gaussian Normalisation, also known as normal distribution, is used to observe how often probabilities are likely to occur closer to a mean value.

Like Uniform distribution, Normal distribution is another way to show probability using a graph.

## Solving using a Calculator

Menu -&gt; 7

* If Continous Distribution \(P\(X &lt;= x\)\), CD
  * Returns the whole area of the graph up a specific value
* If Probability Density at one points \(P\(X = x\)\), PD
  * Returns the probability density at the point x
* If you want the area to the right \(P\(X &gt; x\), CD
  * 1 - \(P\(X &lt;= x\)\)

## Representation

X ~ N\(mean, standard deviation\)

### Formula

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28173%29.png)

**Where y is the vertical height of a point on the normal distribution and is equal to f\(x\), and x is a random variable.**

**The mean, can also be called the expected value, E\(X\), or the sign, mu.**

**The standard deviation, sigma, is any positive number.**

**The total area under every normal curve is 1. There are infinitely many normal distributions.**

**The variance is equivalent to the standard deviation, squared.**

## The Mean and Standard Deviation

If the mean increases on a normal distribution graph, the graph will shift over to the right, and vice versa.

If the standard deviation increases, the graph will become more flat, with the area being spread more evenly across the graph, and vice versa.

## Standard Normal Distribution

Assuming X ~ N\(mean, standard deviation\), we can standardise the random variable X:

Z = \(X - mean\) / standard deviation

Z ~ N\(0, 1\)

### Graph

Standarising in theory, can be visualised like so:

If you split the standardised graph down the middle, both havles represent 0.5.

### Example

### Why?

Because in the past, areas of a normal distribution curved were done by Gauss, by hand. So they had a quick lookup table using the Z values to get areas of a curve quickly.
