# Bionomial Distribution

## Definition

A **binomial distribution** can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times. The binomial is a type of distribution that has **two possible outcome.**

## Formula

Where \(n x\) is \(n C x\), and ! means factorial \(0! = 1\)

`X ~ Bin (n, p)` is used to denote any binomial calculations. This is written before any probability calculations, where n is the number of trials, and p is the probability of success of a trial.

**This is the formula for an exact number**, for example, for exactly 3 heads to be obtained in 5 coin flips:

## **Bernoulli Distribution**

The bonimal distribution is similar to the Bernoulli distribution. A Bernouilli trial: If there is **only 1 trial** with probability of success p and probability of failure 1-p, this is called a Bernouilli distribution. \(special case of the binomial with n=1\)
