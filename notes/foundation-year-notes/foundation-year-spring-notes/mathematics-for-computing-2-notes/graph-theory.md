# Set Theory

Set theory is about a collection of objects \(elements\). The order of these elements doesnt matter, and it doesnt matter how often elements are repeated.

This means that 2 sets can be equal, even if they are not in the same order. A key to understanding set theory is understanding the symbols that come with it.

**Set theory is home to Venn Diagrams.**

## Standard Sets

Note that Z+ indicates a positive integer set, whilst Z- would indicate a negative integer set. Q are rational numbers, so floats.

## Subets

There can also be subsets. Where a set, can be found within another set. For example, if set A is 2 elements, that are also in set B that has 4 elements, A is a subset of B.

## Cardinality of Sets

If a set S contains n distinct elements, n E N,we call S a we call S a finite setfinite set with with cardinality ncardinality n. Can be . Can be written as n\(S\) or \|S\|.written as n\(S\) or \|S\|.

## Cartesian Product

## Set Operations

To prove sets are equal, we can use Venn Diagrams. Or we can use a **membership table**.
