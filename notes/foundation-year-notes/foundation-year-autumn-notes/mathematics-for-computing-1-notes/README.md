# Mathematics for Computing 1

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand mathematical notation and the functionality of symbolic expressions
* Understand the basic principles of differential calculus
* Manipulate matrices and vectors
* Understand how to apply numerical and graphical methods to solve real world mathematical problems

## Outline

This module equips foundation students with core mathematical skills that are essential to progression through the Sussex computer science degree programmes. The material draws on GCSE \(level 2\) and AS/A2 \(level 3\) content and is intended to build the maths skills with students entering foundation year with a prior level 2 maths qualification, and to reinforce skills for those with a prior level 3 maths qualification. There is a strong emphasis on the practical computing applications of maths topics, and in using computing tools such as MATLAB and Excel to solve practical maths problems.

#### Problem Set 1 and 2

This coursework consists of a set of 10 problems. The following rubric appears on the front of the coursework documents:

1. Answer all the questions. There are 10 questions in total.
2. Show your workings where appropriate. You can still get credit for a question with an incorrect final answer if your workings show that you understood what the problem was and how to solve it.
3. Do not copy the work of another student. Plagiarism is a very serious matter. Discussion between students is to be encouraged â€“ copying is an academic disciplinary matter.
4. Check that you provide any working or information that the question asks for.
5. Hand your submission in on time. There are penalties for late submission.
6. If I cannot read your submission, I cannot mark it. It is your responsibility to ensure that the presentation of your submission is appropriate for a University student.
7. Do not forget to state units if they are relevant and apply to a question.
8. You should use any calculating aids your feel appropriate to help you solve the problems including, although not limited to, calculators, spreadsheets such as Excel and MATLAB.
9. If you do not understand the questions, you can get help at the workshop sessions.
10. Each of the questions is out of 10, so this assignment is marked out of a total of 100.
11. Ensure your candidate number is on your final submission. It is surprising how many students forget this basic information.

**General marking advice:**

* The questions do have a right answer, but there is often many different way of arriving at the answer.
* You must show workings to get any marks for an answer. 
* Marks will be deducted for forgotten units \(where they can be known\).
* Where you make an error, you will lose marks at the first point of the error, but you will marked on an "error carried forwards" basis.
* There is no negative marking scheme, so it is always worth attempting to answer a question.
* I am well aware that there are online tools that can be used to answer some of these questions. You are only fooling yourself if you use them to answer your coursework questions. The smart way of using such tools is to use them to check your answers, not do the work for you.

#### Assignment Guidance

Some general advice on the best way to approach this coursework:

* Start early.
* Answer questions once you understand the topic they relate to. 
* If you can't answer a question, it's likely we just haven't reached the relevant topic yet.
* Use the seminar/support sessions and other help channels.  The seminars have various scheduled worksheets and other activities, but questions about the coursework are always relevant and can be raised during them.
* There is no such thing as a dumb question. Don't be afraid to say that you don't understand how to do something.
* Don't leave coursework until the last minute.
* Think about using the full range of ideas and tools that we will explore in this module to help you answer the questions. Not everything has a simple algebraic solution.
* This problem set has 10 questions.
