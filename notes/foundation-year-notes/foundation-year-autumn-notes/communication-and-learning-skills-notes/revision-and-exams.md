# Revision and Exams

## Overview

### Revision

A lot of the lecture content can be summarised as: Revise consistently, be prepared and use skills hub for and study skills. All of which is covered in my notes on cognitive science that can be found [here](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/wiki/cognitive-science).

### Exam

I have only one exam on the 15th of Jan, being my maths for computing 1 exam, that lasts 3 hours.

The lectures covered basic points such as having different memorisation techniques, staying calm, being prepared and understanding your own personal working methods for tackling exams.

Exams are not punishments, they are more so a paper to test and apply the knowledge you have gained over term, thus a lot of the main points can be hammered home with my notes on memory that can be found [here](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/wiki/cognitive-science/metacognition/memory).
