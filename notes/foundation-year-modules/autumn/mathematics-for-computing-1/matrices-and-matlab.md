# Matrices and MATLAB

## Matrices

 A [**matrix** ](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-introduction.html)is an array of numbers represented in columns and rows, an example is below.

![A 2x2 matrix](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2817%29.png)

A is said to be a2×2 matrix because it has two rows and two columns. These are the **dimensions** of A

In general a matrix is m×n matrix if it has m rows and n columns. This is an important convention to remember.

### Scalar multiplication

This is where you times the matrix by an integer, forumla below.

## MATLAB



MATLAB can be integrated with the programming language C

3 by 3 matrix grid:

x = \[1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9\]

imagesc\(var\) will print an colour image of the data. It's an image function
