# Logic and Combinational Logic

## Logic

* A logic gate an implementation, usually with an electronic circuit, of a Boolean function
* A Boolean function is one that uses just two values \(just like in programming\)
  * TRUE / 1 / ON
  * FALSE / 0 / OFF
* A Boolean function may have 1 or more inputs, and exactly 1 output

## The logic gates

### Boolean expressions

## Karnaugh Maps

Karnaugh maps are a method to display a truth table, these help us solve electronic circuits, to solve logic problems

## Gray Code form

In gray code form, only 1 bit changes at a time. Gray form itself in maths means that only one piece of information changes at a time, being the bits.
