# Differentiation

## Differentiation

Differentiation belongs to calculus, and touches on rate of change. Differentiation, was co-invented by Isaac Newton and  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The derivative is the slope of a tangent of an arbitrary slope, in geometrical terms. This is where a straight line can be drawn on a point of a curve, and allows for you to find a gradient at a specific point.

Derivatives have applications throughout all of nature, image edges, velocity, fluctuations in interest rates, spikes in noisy audio data, market changes \(bull and bear\) and more.

## Terminology

* Delta \(triangle\) = small change, so
* Deltax = small change in x
* d = infinitesimally small change \(ideally the minimum chage, closest to zero we can find\)
* dx = infinitesimally small change in x
* dy/dx = the derivative, the instantaneous rate of change in y relative to x
