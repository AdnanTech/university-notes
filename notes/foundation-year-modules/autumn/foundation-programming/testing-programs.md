# Refactoring Code & Passing Variables

## Refactoring code

Refactoring code is where you take a pre existing large function, and split it up into smaller functions. the purpose of this is to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software, while preserving its functionality of the code. 

Refactored code makes testing easier, as you can see which module needs. Refactoring also makes any future updates to software a lot easier, as it will be easier to read, thus faster to add new functions.

There aren't a lot of code examples, as refactoring code can be seen everywhere. Also, it should be done all the time, to keep the code tidy as you are progressing in a project.

## Passing by Value & by Reference

### By Value

By value passes a copy of a variable, so if you change the passed variable, only the copy is changed, not the original

### By Reference

By reference passes a pointer to the reference, so any changes made to the variable, changes the variable globally.
