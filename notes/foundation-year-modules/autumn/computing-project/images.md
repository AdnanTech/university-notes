### Commonly used Images

* JPEG
  * Joint Photographic Experts Group
  * Photos
* GIF
  * Graphics Interchange Format
* PNG
  * Portable Network Graphic
  * High Quality Images/Text combination

### Image Formats

### JPEG

JPG, also known as JPEG \(Joint Photographic Experts Group\), released in 1992. They use a complex compression algorithm called "lossy" compression. JPEG is the standard format for most digital cameras. JPEG files are great for making smaller files. As well as being great images with more than 256 colours. Uses 24-bit colour.

Human eyes see light and dark better than color detail. JPEG uses this weakness to help compression. It sacrifices some colour detail to save space.

**Best uses:** Black and white images, images with complex colouring, still file imagery and real life photographs.

### PNG

PNG \(Portable Network Graphics\) is a raster \(pixel\) graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. Created in 1996, PNG was created to replace GIFs. They also use alpha channels, which allows for transparency, but also used to cause compatability issues.

PNG-8 Bit was the original successor of GIF, there was 256 colours and 1-bit transparency, PNG files were smaller than GIF files. PNG-24 bit PNGs can include over 16 million colours. Lossless compression means larger files than JPEG.

Best uses: Web images, flat areas of colours, logos, transparent or semitransparent images, great for text images, images in the middle of the editing process, complex images, like real life files, IF file size is not an issue.

### GIF

Used for sprites, Graphics Interchange Format, created in 1987 by CompuServe, uses lossless compression to store image data using indexed colour, meaning each image can include a maximum of 256 colours. They can preserve transparency.

You can use "Dithering" to make the files even smaller. This is the process where two pixels combine to make one.

**Best uses:** Simple images like line drawings, colour, boarders ad simple illustrations, Animations \(GIFs\), web graphics with not many colours and very small icons.

### BMP

BMP, Bitmap image file, also known as device independent bitmap \(DIB\). Created in 1994, does not use compression. Now owned by Windows, can be compressed by lossless as it is made up of individual pixels. Large files, high quality and rich in colour.

Can create arrays of pixel data to store in memory, to represent an image.

**Best Uses:** Images that will be sent to a printer, Editing lots of layers of images, preserving layers and alpha transparency and any type of pixel based images.

### SVG

Scalable Vector Graphics images, used for vector images only, so it cannot be compressed. They scale well mathematically, and can easily be converted to bitmap.

Best Uses: Vector Images

## Drawing Images \(Image map\)

You can also draw bitmaps and make them clickable. Look at the tag called &lt;map&gt; and usemap="\#mapname". You can embed an image to a map ,and have each shape clickable if you use the co-ordinates.

## HTML Images

* [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) for img tag
* target="\_blank" attribute will open in a new tab
* linking a href into an image is the way to link images
* [picture tag mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)
