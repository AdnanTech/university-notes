# Types Of AI

## Pre Reading

### Soft AI

Just a method that works, not necessarily inspired by anything – just a means to an end \(Good Old Fashioned AI – GOFAI\)

The most common techniques include:

* Search
* Using random guesswork
* Logic
* Consider how we could create a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe

### Hard AI

A method that attempts to emulate some aspect of intelligence using inspiration from e.g. biology

Two popular approaches:

* Artificial neural network
* Genetic algorithms
  * Essentially involves generating possible solutions and rating them
  * We then choose the best N answers
  * Combine different halves of the best solutions to make new solutions

This is just scratching at the surface of what is possible

You will learn about many techniques as you study further

But they are all techniques “in isolation”

Real systems \(like a robot\) are complex with many parts

So next time we will think about how complex systems can be organised AI style
