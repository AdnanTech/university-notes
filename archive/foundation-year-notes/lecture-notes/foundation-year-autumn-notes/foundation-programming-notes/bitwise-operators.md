# Bitwise Operators

## Bitwise OR

The _bitwise OR_ operator (|) returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits oBitwise Operators

Bitwise operators can be used for manipulating data at the bit level, as well as in numerical computations to make calculation processes faster.

### Bitwise AND

The _bitwise AND_ operator (&) returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are 1s.

### Bitwise OR

The _bitwise OR_ operator (|) returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either or both operands are 1s.

### Bitwise XOR

The bitwise XOR operator (^) can be used as a simple encryption method. XOR returns a 1 where the operand combinations are different (10 or 01).

## enumf either or both operands are 1s.
