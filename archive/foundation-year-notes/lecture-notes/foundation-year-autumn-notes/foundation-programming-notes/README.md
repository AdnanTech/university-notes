# Foundation Programming

## Learning Outcomes

* Employ a range of basic programming constructs to develop a programming solution in a high-level programming language
* Transform a simple program specification into a design using a standard design technique
* Use a programming environment to edit, debug and compile a simple program
*  Devise and use a test plan for verification of a program, and draw conclusions from the outcomes

## Outline

To provide the student with an understanding of how to design algorithms to solve simple problems in a suitable high-level programming language, and how to code, document and test those solutions. 

* Overview of range and types of programming languages
* Introduction to a development environment and use of online help facilities
* Algorithm design: using a top-down technique
* Simple data types and naming conventions
* Controlling flow using selection statements
* Controlling flow using iteration
* Using functions for re-use
* Modular programming
* Complex data types: records and arrays
* Programming standards: layout and documentation
* Verification & testing

Each programming projects is to be submitted via Canvas as a word processed document. The document, for each, should contain the project design, the C programming code, the test logs and a written evaluation of the programming project. A contents page using appropriate page numbering should be included.The project marking criteria is based on the:

1.     Presentation of the Word document.
2.     Design of the programming project.
3.     Functionality of the C programming code.
4.     C programming code efficiency and its conformity to the course’s “Style Rules for C Programming”.
5.     Test results.
6.     Ease of use and the presentation of the user interface.
7.     A 500 word evaluation of the programming project.

## Technical Requirements

* A desktop PC or Laptop
* An Integrated Development Environment (**IDE**) for C/C++:
  * **Dev-C++** as your IDE on Windows
  * **Xcode **on macOS
* Internet Access (online sessions via Zoom)
