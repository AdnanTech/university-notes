# More Trigonometry, Logs and Exponents

## Sin and Cosine Rule

Sine and Cosine rules are used when we have triangles that to _not _have a right angle to them. Thus, due to no right angle, there is no such thing as a hypotenuse.

### Sin Rule

We use sin rule when you are given:

* 2 sides and an angle opposite to one of the two sides
* 1 side and 2 angles

### Cosine Rule

We use the cosine rule when you are given:

* 2 sides and an angle
* 3 sides

### Area of a triangle

Essentially, we look for 1/2 x perpendicular height

### Triangles and Pythagoras linked to Trig

This triangle also proves that the cosine rule is an extension of pythagoras' theorem, this proves that there is no such thing as different types of triangles, its just that in the right angle triangles, its very simplified. You can also prove sin using this, if we consider sohcahtoa.

## Logarithms and Exponents

### Logarithms and Exponents Fundamentals

* **Exponent**: The power to which a number, symbol, or expression is to be raised. For example, the 3 in x^3. 
* **Logarithm**: The **logarithm** of a number is the **exponent** by which another fixed value, the base, has to be raised to produce that number.
* The inverse of the logarithmic operation is exponentiation, and vice versa
* The logarithm is commonly used in many fields: that with base 2 in computer science, that with base e in pure mathematics and financial mathematics, and that with base 10 in natural science and engineering.

## Lecture Notes

* Logarithms are a form of transform
  * this means one the key uses is to take a harder problem, into a simpler one
* John Napier invented logarithms
* log(0) doesn't exit nor does 10^x = 0
* logarithms come up in science and nature, such as volume, the way your ear listens to volume, is through amplifiers, which is adjusted in headphones
