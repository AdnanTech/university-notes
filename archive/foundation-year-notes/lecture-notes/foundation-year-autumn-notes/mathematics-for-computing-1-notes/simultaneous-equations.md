# Simultaneous Equations

## Pre Reading

Simultaneous equations are used a lot in the [finance field](https://sciencing.com/10-can-used-everyday-life-8710568.html). They serve a purpose which is to solve the co ordinate values at which a point is equal, which in life, gives us information for a prediction.

There are 2 main ways of solving simultaneous equations:

1. **The graphical method**
2. **The algebraic method**

## The Graphical Method

Draw a graph with both of the equations on. Where they meet, is where both equations are satisfied simultaneously, which is the solution. The only limiting factor here is whether you can read a graph or if they meet. This can also be extended to 3D, and even more than 2 variables (x, y, z, a, b, c). However, as you add more dimensions and more variables, the graph will become harder and harder to read.

## The algebraic method

This is where you times, or divide one of the equations to get some of the same co-effecients, then minus one from another. This also finds the solutions as you end up with one equation that will satisfy both equations. The advantage of this method is you do not need to draw a graph, thus faster in most cases, especially when you have more than 2 variables. If we have, for example, 3 variables, we have to assume that all 3 equations are different, otherwise it cannot be solved. In addition, there are cases when algebra does not work, for example when lines are parrallel, you will get faulty algebra. As with this method, you rely on the graphs definitely having a solution at a point, where they cross.

## The discriminant

Quadratics and linear are both solved using those 2 methods above.

Graph methods are useful for when we want a rough estimate, or to see how many solutions there will be to two simultaneous equations

When using the algebraic method, we can also substitute, as well as eliminate.

Be careful when square rooting equations, as they give positive and negative values

The options for solving 2 equations simultaneously:

1. 2 real roots (2 intersections)
2. 1 real root (1 intersection)
3. no real roots (no solutions as the equations never meet)

Based on the equation b^2 - 4ac

## Lecture Notes

Solving quadratics simultaneously is the same as solving linear equations simultaneously. Using substitution, or graphically.

square root of x is NOT a function

when messing with the square root of x in a simultaneous equation, the ideal scenario is if you square the equation(s) so that the square x no longer exists. Or you could substitute root x for z and solve that way_. In that case, root x is plus or minus, so you have to be careful with the substitution, as there will be 2 values, but they may be in the same value or both values since root is plus or minu_s. __ Hence the method without square roots is easier. Or perhaps also use a graph to validate the answers
