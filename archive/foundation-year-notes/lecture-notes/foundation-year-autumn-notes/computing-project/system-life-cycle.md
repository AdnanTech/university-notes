# System Life Cycle

## System Life Cycle

1. Problem
2. Analyse
3. Design
4. Implement
5. Test
6. Install
7. Maintain
8. Evaluate

Might be able to get funding for the hardware? Ask Ramiz, he prefers if the list of items comes in one piece.

## Problem

Could be due for a new system upgrade due to:

* Ineffeciency
* Out of date
* Volume of data \(scaling\)
* Inflexible
* Can add new features

It could use new tech:

* New technologies \(Internet\)
* New Operating systems
* increased processing power
* new commercial opportunities

## Analyse

Gather as much information as possible

* Interview
* Quentionnaire
* Observe the current system
* Evaluate existing solutions
* Examine the existing documentation

Also have to analyse feasability:

* Should we use the old system? How much of it?
* Should we use a pre made library/framework? How customisable does it need to be?
* Should we buy off the shelf systems? Does the solution tailor fir all requirements?

## Design

Top down design - breaking it into classes and methods, with an aspect of modularity. This allows for containers of progress.

Design methods

* Screen designs with annotations
* Skeleton code
* Pseudocode
* Class diagram
* Use case diagram
* Sequence diagram
* Entity Relationship Diagram, crow feet / chen notation
* Normalisation
* Data dictionary
* Database and Relation Schema

## Implement

Creating the solution based on design, this includes

* Using a software pachage, to create a customised database solution
* Writing code / to solve the problem
* Website / web app

Consider the interface too:

* Ease of Use - good HCI, human computer interface
* Suitability - appropiate
* Technology - Works on a computer
* Ergonomics, comfortable to use, visually clean etc

Have working prototypes.

## Test

Test early, test ofren, document all the time.

## Install

Install the system into a working environment

## Maintain

Maintain the system, which means:

* Perfective - minor improvements
* Adaptive - changed to fit requirements or deadline
* Corrective - fix the bugs that pop up

## Evaluate

Evaluate the process of building the system. Suggestions for improvements, did i hit the original objectives?
