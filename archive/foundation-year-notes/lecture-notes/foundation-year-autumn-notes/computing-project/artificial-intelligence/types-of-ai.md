## Types of AI

### Soft AI

Just a method that works, not necessarily inspired by anything – just a means to an end \(Good Old Fashioned AI – GOFAI\)

The most common techniques include:

* Search
* Using random guesswork
* Logic

Consider how we could create a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe

It uses the minimax algorithm to score all possible plays in a way of minimizing loss in a worse case scenario, as well as maximizing winning at the same time. It calculates possibilities using a tree structure, to choose the route with the most winning possibilities.

### Using Logic

If A -&gt; B implies NOT B -&gt; NOT A. We can encode basic rules of logic to solve problems. 

### Hard AI

Turing took the idea that humans are machines on a complex level. That we can take a machine, and with enough laws and rules based on humans, and once exposed, the machine can exhibit human levels of intelligence.

A method that attempts to emulate some aspect of intelligence using inspiration from e.g. biology

Two popular approaches:

### Artificial neural network

* Uses the concept of human brain cells and neuro plasicity
* The logic of neural networks can be represented with a logic table
* One neuron \(processor\) is called a perceptron in computer science terms, and these can be combined to create truth laws based on input, for example an or table, where there is a pipeline that takes the inputs, and performs a calculation, and using a relational operator, determines if the statement is true of false.
* The process of building a network with lots of different rules, and adjusting the rules until it solves the problem, Back propagation is a key way, as well as reinforcement learning.
* What's interesting is neuro plasicity when brain cells are damaged, as more specialised cells can reform to take the role of another damaged cell, as well as their own.

### Genetic algorithms

* Essentially involves generating possible solutions and rating them
* We then choose the best N answers
* Combine different halves of the best solutions to make new solutions
* Mutation is key to evolution which is key to survival of a species. Related to Computer science because it hones in on the idea that sometimes you have to change rules to progress.
* As mutation takes the best ideas of an entity and carries them forward.

These can be combined to make a hybrid technique, which combines the approaches to solve the problem easier.
