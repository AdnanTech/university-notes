# HTML

## HTML

_Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language that defines the structure of content on a webpage_

* You can verify your HTML [here](https://validator.w3.org).
* HTML is a upgraded version of XML
* HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way
  * The opening tag defines the way an element is displayed, some examples
    * image
    * url
    * italics

### General Form

* General form of a HTML element `<opening tag> Content </closing tag>`

### Notes

* A** html tag i**s a set of characters that sets the way content is displayed on a web page
* An **element **comprises of the opening tag, closing tag, and the content within the tags
* **Attributes **contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content, they tend to be classes or ids.
  * An attribute should always have the following:
    * A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
    * The attribute name followed by an equal sign
    * The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation mark
  * (identifier) The **`class`** **global attribute **is a space-separated list of the case-sensitive classes of the element. Classes allow CSS and Javascript to select and **access specific elements via the class selectors** (multiple) or functions like the DOM method `document.getElementsByClassName`.
    * `class` is the attribute _name_ and `example-class` is the attribute _value_. The `class` attribute allows you to give the element a **non-unique identifier **that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same `class` value) with style information and other things.
      * `<p class="example-class">Lorem Ipsum</p>`
      * `         <p id="example-class">Lorem Ipsum</p>`
  * (Identifier, not the same as selector) The **`id` global attribute** defines an identifier (ID) which must be** unique in the whole document**. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking and styling (with CSS)
    * id is the attribute _name _and example-id is the attribute value
      * `<p class="example-id">Lorem Ipsum</p>`
        * `         <p id="example-id">Lorem Ipsum</p>`
* You can create web forms using the [\<input> tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5\_input_types) nested within a [\<form> block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
  * using the`<input>` element, you can specify the type to create an input form
    * phone number input type`<input type="tel" id="tel" name="tel">`
    * password input type `<input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">`
  * ``
* The **HTML Content Division element** (**`<div>`**) is the generic container for flow content. it has no styling until applied with CSS. It basically just defines a container for HTML content
* CSS **Flexbox **has replaced XHTML **framesets**
* There is also `<pre>` tags, which stands for pre formatted text
* There are also description lists, with discription tag and discription data that has its own set of tags respectively

## HTML Semantics

HTML **Semantics (section tags) **and HTML entities (symbols that are reserved by html) are important and have their respective uses

## **HTML Tables**

The **HTML `<table>` element** represents tabular data â€” that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data

Tables have their own [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table), you can merge them, nest them, dictate rows and columns etc

Examples are in the [code base](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/code/code/html/tables), as well as in the personal University Of Sussex [git repo](https://github.com/AdnanTech/UniversityOfSussex/blob/master/ComputingProject/html-basics.html), in answering the second worksheet we were given
