# Data vs Information

## Data

Data is a collection of **unprocessed** facts or figures, including alphanumeric characters, text, Numbers, Symbols, that has no meaning. **An example of data is a spatiotemporal data set, where data is collected on how objects move across both space and time, for example shipping movement over a geographic area over time.**

## Information

**Information** is **data** that has been **processed** within/into a **context/form** to give it meaning. _Information is essentially interpreted data, and organized facts/knowledge. ****_**An example, using spatial-temporal reasoning, includes using a map or compass to collect data, and determining a direction to go to, merging in traffic, visualising and processing the moving cars in the lanes while driving.**
