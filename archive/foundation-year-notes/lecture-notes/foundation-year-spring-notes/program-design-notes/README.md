# Program Design

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe and explain some of the key concepts of object oriented design
* Produce a use-case analysis from a set of software system requirements
* Apply OOD methods to develop a simple program using a suitable programming language
* Describe and explain a number of key data-structures used in developing software

## Outline

This module aims to provide the student with an understanding of object oriented program design and hands-on experience of designing, writing, testing and documenting object-oriented programs

* Software models using OO and UML
* Designing classes to solve a simple programming problem
* Data structures and the algorithms needed to manipulate them
* Stakeholders and requirements in software development
* Managing the software development process.

Each programming projects is to be submitted via Canvas as a word processed document. The document, for each, should contain the project design, the C++ programming code, the test logs and a written evaluation of the programming project. A contents page using appropriate page numbering should be included.The project marking criteria is based on the:

1. Presentation of the Word document.
2. Design of the programming project.
3. Functionality of the C++ programming code.
4. C++ programming code efficiency and its conformity to the course’s “Style Rules for C Programming”.
5. Test results.
6. Ease of use and the presentation of the user interface.
7. A 500 word evaluation of the programming project.
