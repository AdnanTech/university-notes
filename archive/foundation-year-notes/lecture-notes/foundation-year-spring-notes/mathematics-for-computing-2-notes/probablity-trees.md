# Probablity Trees

Tree diagrams, also known as probability trees, are ways of showing possibilities of two or more events, by drawing a diagram.

Pretty straight forward, all you have to understand is that to get the result of an event sequence, you multiply the sequence. Also that all event sequences must add up to 1.

## Example \(Independent\)

Here is an example of: 10 coloured beads in a bag â€“ 3 Red, 2 Blue, 5 Green. One taken, colour noted, **returned to bag \(this implies independent events\)**, then a second taken.

1st and 2nd display 1st event, and 2nd event, This we are taking two beads from the bag.
