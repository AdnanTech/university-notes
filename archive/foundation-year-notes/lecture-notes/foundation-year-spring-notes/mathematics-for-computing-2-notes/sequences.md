# Sequences

## Arithmetic

Arithmetic is a simple sequence of numbersm where there is a **common difference between the numbers \(negative, fractional etc\)**. We can write the sum of a series using sigma notation:

Where 6 and 1 are the upper and lower limits respectively.

## Geometric

**Geometric progressions do not have a constant common difference, instead a ratio between two consecutive terms is constant.** Using sigma notation to sum a series like before:

This is essentially saying:

### Sum to Infinity

The sum to infinity tells us if a geometric series is converging or not. **The requirement is that the r value, absoluted \(positive, not negative\) must be less than 1, for the series to be convergent, else it is not convergent**.

In layman terms, if it is convergent, when we approach n = infinity, the terms will get smaller and smaller, meaning that the sum of the series will become a defined value, the series converges on that specific value.

Therefore 112.6 is where the series converges, any n value above, will yield the same result.
