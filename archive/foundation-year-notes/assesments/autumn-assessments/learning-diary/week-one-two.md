# Week one/two

**Foundation Programming: **The past 2 weeks, we covered the _fundamental basics of C_, as well as discussing the large array of **different types of programming languages**. I decided to do further research and learned that [programming languages ](../../../lecture-notes/foundation-year-autumn-notes/foundation-programming-notes/types-and-range-of-programming-languages.md#range-of-programming-languages)are leaves to the tree of the [**programming paradigm**](../../../lecture-notes/foundation-year-autumn-notes/foundation-programming-notes/types-and-range-of-programming-languages.md#types-of-programming-languages)**. **This consolidated my knowledge further, as it creates a _network of programming theory_ in my thoughts. I have also gone ahead and created a [public GitBook space for brief code examples](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/code/), which I intend to expand further and use **useful programming methods/concepts** I have learned **from working as a programmer** as well as **useful code blocks** I have picked up **from any side projects **over time. I have also added a [public git repository to add all of my c examples](https://github.com/AdnanTech/UniversityOfSussex) we have covered in lectures or labratory sessions.

**Communication and Learning Skills: **In the last two weeks, we briefly touched on the **module overview**, as well as the higher education _soft _skills, which can be summarized, as I see it to **metacognitive **skills, **social **skills, **time management**, **organisation **and **self-reflection**. Although the course has felt slow, it is understandable as the first weeks are_ introductory type lessons_. I have **created a** (_private_) **trello board** **to keep up with my university work**. I also have a [knowledge base](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/wiki/) where I ~~intend to add~~ have added my [personal research notes on metacognition](https://adnantech.gitbook.io/wiki/neuroscience/metacognition) ~~by the end of the weekend~~. I also have planned to make a **blog **to use **as my portfolio**, which will be created using **no frameworks**, purely php and javascript, as a **helpful precursor** to our computing modules, such has _HTML, CSS, PHP and JS._

**Mathematics For Computing 1: **The first two weeks of mathematics has been **trivial**, as it is mainly GCSE level of math, which I have prior experience in. Because it is has been fairly straightforward, I have gone ahead and **attempted and marked topics 1 and 2's worksheets**, ~~which I intend to scan and upload to a git repository by the end of the week.~~ which I have **scanned** and **uploaded **to the [git repo](https://github.com/AdnanTech/maths-for-computing-worksheets) as well as the [maths module](../../../lecture-notes/foundation-year-autumn-notes/mathematics-for-computing-1-notes/). The **assignment **has also been **released **to us, which I have _completed _a first **draft **for, in which every question has been **attempted**.

**Computing Project: **The first two weeks of the computing project module we have had introductory lessons, as well as some lessons on the **Internet** and the **World Wide Web**. Because it is topic I have previously covered, I decided to make **pre-cursor notes** on the **next 2 topics**, **HTML **and **CSS**. I also looked further into what the [**internet **](../../../lecture-notes/foundation-year-autumn-notes/computing-project/introduction-to-the-internet-and-world-wide-web.md#the-internet)actually is, and what a** network of networks** really meant in terms of the _global_, _local _and _nano _scale on _private _or _public _sectors. I also have a project in mind (_private _GitBook space) that I am currently scoping with a **top down design** to break to program into its constituent **attributes **and **methods **(classes), as well as any** hardware limitations** and **key concepts** to tackle early on, so that the **project **can be **completed **within the **time frame given**.

**Summative Evaluation: **Overall i think the first two weeks have been a **nice introductory** to life as an undergraduate computer science student. I have set up **appropriate **[**workflows**](broken-reference), such as _Google Calendar_, _GitHub_, _GitBook, Trello, MindNode _and _Quizlet, _which i intend to make minor adjustments to improve over **time**_._ The goal of the different workflows is to have **different ways to retain knowledge **and **connect different methods of learning**, to strengthen the _neural connections_ of the knowledge in my brain. I also got a rough feel for **how many hours** I should **dedicate **to **University **content, so that I can figure out how many hours to dedicate to **work**. It is crucial I be _organised _and _manage my time_ wisely with **university and work**, or I will fall behind. In short, I have felt as if the course so far has been slow paced, but that is to be expected, as _not everyone_ has programmed/has a background in math. Thus, I decided to go ahead and take initiative by spending time to do more **in-depth reading**, on top of **reading ahead** to further consolidate my **knowledge field **of computer science and math as a whole.
